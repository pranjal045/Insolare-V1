If, at any time:
(a)	actual progress is too slow to complete within the Time for Completion; and/or
(b)	progress has fallen (or will fall) behind the then-current Owner-approved Programme under Clause 7.3 (Programme),
other than as a result of a cause listed in Clause 7.4 (Extension or Acceleration of Time for Completion), then the Owner may instruct the Contractor to submit, under Clause 7.3 (Programme), a revised Programme and supporting report describing the revised methods which the Contractor proposes to adopt in order to expedite progress and complete within the Time for Completion.
Unless the Owner notifies otherwise, the Contractor shall adopt these revised methods, which may require increases in the working hours and/or in the numbers of Contractor's Personnel and/or Goods, at the risk and cost of the Contractor. If these revised methods cause the Owner to incur additional costs, the Contractor shall subject to Clause 2.4 (Owner’s Claims) pay these costs to the Owner, in addition to delay damages (if any) under Clause 7.6 (Delay Damages) below.
Delay Damages
If the Contractor fails to comply with Clause 7.2 (Time for Completion), the Contractor shall, subject to Clause 2.4 (Owner’s Claims) and when requested by the Owner, pay delay damages to the Owner in an amount as provided in Schedule 2 (Schedule of Payments). 
The Parties agree that the delay damages are a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of the damages likely to be sustained by the Owner as a result of the Contractor's breach of its obligations as set out in Clause 7.2 (Time for Completion.)
Suspension of Work
The Owner may at any time instruct the Contractor to suspend progress of part or all of the Works.  During such suspension, the Contractor shall protect, store and secure such part or whole of the Works (as the case may be) against any deterioration, loss or damage.

Consequences of Suspension
If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost from complying with the Owner's instructions under Clause 7.7 (Suspension of Work) and/or from resuming the work, the Contractor shall give notice to the Owner and shall be entitled subject to Clause 20.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to:
(a)	an extension of time for any such delay, if Completion is or will be delayed, under Clause 7.4 (Extension or Acceleration of Time for Completion); and
(b)	payment of any such Cost, which shall be added to the Contract Price.
After receiving this notice, the Owner shall proceed in accordance with Clause 20.1 (Contractor’s Claims) or Clause 3.4 (Determinations) to determine, or agree or determine, these matters (as the case may be).
The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time for, or to payment of the Cost incurred in, making good the consequences of the Contractor's faulty design, workmanship, or materials, or of the Contractor's failure to protect, store or secure in accordance with Clause 7.7 (Suspension of Work).
Prolonged Suspension
If the suspension under Clause 7.7 (Suspension of Work) has continued for more than [Insert number of days], the Contractor may request Owner's permission to proceed. If the Owner does not give permission within [Insert number of days] after being requested to do so, the Contractor may, by giving notice to the Owner, treat the suspension as an omission under Clause 11 (Variations and Adjustments) of the affected part of the Works. If the suspension affects the whole of the Works and continues for [Insert number of days], the Contractor may give notice of termination under Clause 15.1 (Termination by Contractor).
Resumption of Work
After the permission or instruction to proceed is given, the Parties shall jointly examine the Works and the Plant affected by the suspension. The Contractor shall make good any deterioration or defect in or loss of the Works, Plant, which has occurred during the suspension.

Tests on Completion
Contractor's Obligations
The Contractor shall give the Owner at least [Insert number of days] advanced preliminary written notice and at least [Insert number of days] advanced final written notice, of the date on which it intends to synchronise the Works to the Grid.
The Contractor shall, at its sole cost and expense, carry out the Tests on Completion in accordance with this Clause 8 (Tests on Completion) and the Schedule of Tests after providing the documents in accordance with Clause 5.3 (As-Built Documents). 
The Tests on Completion shall be carried out to ascertain (among other things) whether the Works meet all Performance Guarantees simultaneously and are in conformance with the requirements of this Contract. The Owner shall be entitled at all times to witness and monitor the conduct of the Tests on Completion.  The Contractor shall notify the Owner at least [Insert number of days] prior to the date on which any Tests on Completion will be conducted. Immediately following any Test on Completion, the Contractor shall forward to the Owner duly certified copies of the results of such Test on Completion.
Neither the witnessing nor monitoring of any Test on Completion by the Owner under this Clause ‎8 (Tests on Completion) nor Owner's failure to make, require or witness any inspection, examination, testing or re-testing of any part of the Works shall in any way relieve the Contractor of any obligations or liabilities under this Contract.
Delayed Tests
If the Tests on Completion are being unduly delayed by the Contractor, the Owner may by notice require the Contractor to carry out the Tests on Completion within [Insert number of days] after receiving the notice.  The Contractor shall carry out the Tests on Completion on such day or days within that period as the Contractor may fix and of which he shall give notice to the Owner.
If the Contractor fails to carry out the Tests on Completion within the above mentioned period, the Owner's Personnel may proceed with the Tests on Completion at the risk and cost of the Contractor. These Tests on Completion shall then be deemed to have been carried out in the presence of the Contractor and the results of the Tests on Completion shall be accepted as accurate.
Performance Guarantees Not Achieved
If the Performance Guarantees are not achieved during the Tests on Completion, the Contractor may, at its own cost and expense make such changes or additions to the Works as may be necessary to simultaneously achieve all of the Performance Guarantees. The Contractor shall notify the Owner upon completion of such changes or additions and repeat the Tests on Completion until the Performance Guarantees have been achieved. To the extent that any such changes, additions or testing substantially denies the Owner the benefit of the Works or any part thereof, the Contractor shall be liable to the Owner (including on a pro-rata basis where such results in a partial reduction in the availability of the Works) for delay damages under Clause 7.6 (Delay Damages).  
Performance Liquidated Damages
Any Performance Liquidated Damages payable under Clause 8.3 (Performance Guarantees Not Achieved) are payable to the Owner as per Schedule 3 (Schedule of Performance Guarantees). The Parties agree that the Performance Liquidated Damages are a genuine and reasonable pre-estimate of the damages likely to be sustained by the Owner as a result of the Contractor's failure to achieve the Performance Guarantees and shall, except in the case of fraud, deliberate default or reckless misconduct, be the Owner's exclusive remedy for failure by the Contractor to achieve the Performance Guarantees.  If the obligation to pay Performance Liquidated Damages is found for any reason to be void, invalid or otherwise inoperative so as to disentitle the Owner to payment thereof, the Owner shall be entitled to claim against the Contractor for damages at law resulting from the Contractor's failure to achieve the Performance Guarantees.

If the Contractor is prevented from carrying out the Tests on Completion for more than [Insert number of days] due to any cause for which the Owner is responsible, the Contractor shall carry out the Tests on Completion as soon as practicable.
If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost as a result of this delay in carrying out the Tests on Completion, the Contractor shall give notice to the Owner and shall be entitled subject to Clause 20.1 (Contractor’s Claims) to:
(a)	an extension of time for any such delay, if Completion is or will be delayed, under Clause 7.4 (Extension or Acceleration of Time for Completion); and
(b)	payment of any Costs which are incurred after the date which is, and which are the result of any such delay exceeding, [Insert number of days] following the commencement of such delay, which Costs shall be added to the Contract Price.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, upon receipt from the Contractor of a notice of delay as referred to in the previous paragraph, the Owner may at its option instruct the Contractor to de-mobilize from the Site all the Contractor Personnel whose activities are prevented or impeded by the delay in testing until such time as the Owner advises the Contractor that the impediment to testing has been resolved and instructs the Contractor to commence or resume testing.
