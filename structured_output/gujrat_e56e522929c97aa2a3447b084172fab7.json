The application plays a pivotal role, as it is responsible for \nactual execution of the tendering process online. A robust and dynamic \napplication seamlessly integrates with the existing systems allowing the user \norganization to customize it according to organizational policies. \n \n2. \nHosting and Bandwidth  \n \nThe application has to be hosted at a secure site where bandwidth is not a \nhindrance when multiple users are logged on the system. The application has \nto be up 24X7 for e-Procurement to achieve its objectives. The reliability of \nthe server and the bandwidth assurance for load bearing in terms of \nsimultaneous usage, are inevitable for the smooth implementation of e- \ntendering for any organization. \n \n3.  \nSecurity and Legal Sanctity \n \nE-Procurement involves a high amount of commercial transactions and also \npublishing of organization specific sensitive data on a public domain. High \nlevel of security has to be ensured so that there is a trustworthy access-control \ntechnology and authorization policy in place. Security has to be maintained \nnot only of the data that is stored on the server but also of the information that \nis in transit, e.g. the bid documents or the bid figures being sent to the server \nby the vendor. The e-Procurement process and the policies that are \nimplemented for the security of the data and communication have to comply to \nthe IT Act of the country so that the transactions and disputes (if any) arising \nthere from, are admissible in the Court of Law. Non-repudiation has to be \ntaken care of within the purview of the Law, for the assurance to the \n \n8\norganization and the vendors. Indian IT Act has well defined provisions for \ndocuments submitted online, electronic records and digitally signed \ndocuments. \n \n2.0 (n)Procure \n \n(n)Procure is a portal created by (n)Code Solutions, a division of GNFC Ltd. \nThis portal offers a complete web-based PKI enabled e-Procurement solution. \nThe solution is offered on an ASP (Application Service Provision) basis.  (PKI \nis Public Key Infrastructure – name given to set of policies, procedures, \ninfrastructure and law to handle electronic signatures and verification \nthereof.) \n(n)Procure enables the organization to implement the tendering process online \nfrom the “raising of indent to the placement of LOI (including reverse auction \nif required)”. (n)Procure is a one stop end to end solution for the entire e-\nprocurement activity.  \n \n3.0 Features of e-Procurement \n \n• Government officials (Users) registration and Right Allocation. \n• Vendor registration & Pre Qualification. \n• Indent creation and approval. \n• Estimated Cost Value (ECV) . \n• Tender Document management. \n• Tender Creation and approval. \n• Tender Publishing. \n• Tender promotion via e-mail alerts. \n• Issue of Corrigendum. \n• Online / Offline Sale of Tender Schedule. \n• Conduction of online Pre Bid meeting. \n• Online bid Submission by vendors (Facility for 2 bid / multiple bid \nsystem). \n• Online Automated Bid Comparatives (Technical and Commercial). \n• Online negotiations. \n• Award of LOI . \n• Reverse Auction / Forward Auction.  \n• Rate contract management. \n• Purchase statistics. \n• Site Access Reports / Web Statistics. \n• Encryption of bids submitted by the vendor (by the public key of the \ntender issuing authority).  \n \n4.0 Process flow of e-Procurement \n \n4.1 Once indent is approved, Digitally Signed tender can be published on the \nwebsite with the facility to download the complete tender documents by the \nprospective vendors. Payment of the tender fees can be achieved through \nonline payment Gateway. The tender documents can be simultaneously sold \noffline if the department desires so. However, the bids are required to be \nsubmitted online. \n \n9\n(n)Procure also provides the facility to amend the tender (if required), extend \nthe tender issue date etc. All such amendments have to be Digitally Signed by \nconcerned authority. Vendors who has selected department in his preference \nlist, will be notified about such amendment / corrigendum through e-mail. \n \n4.2 After downloading the Tender documents vendors can submit their bids. \nThese bids will be digitally signed and encrypted. The Encryption will be done \nusing Public Key of the Tender Issuing Authority. Thus, privacy is ensured. \nRequired EMD can be paid online. Payment gateway is provided to accept \nonline payment for following banks. \n \n1. State Bank of India. \n2. Bank of India. \n3. Union Bank of India \n4. Punjab National Bank \n5. Unit Trust of India. \n6. HDFC. \n7. ICICI. \n8. Centurion Bank of Punjab.  \n \n4.3 All necessary documents (such as Income Tax registration, Sales Tax \nregistration proof) can be scanned and submitted duly digitally signed as part \nof the bid. There will be department defined format, in which vendors will \nsubmit the bid. (to make the evaluation online).  \nModification of the bid submitted by vendor (before tender closing date) is \npermitted. All such changes / modification will be digitally signed by the \nvendor.  \nVendors can also track status of their Bids. For example, in a tender if \nTechnical Bid and Price Bids are required separately and Technical Bid is \nevaluated before opening Price Bid, vendor can know the comparative of \nTechnical Bid. The status can be tracked online. \n \n4.4 The offers received electronically will be stored in a Time locked box \nwhich can only be opened by the authorized Tender Opening Committee \nnominee on due date and time.  \nThe purchase department will, at the specified date and time, open the \ntechnical bids of all the suppliers and evaluate them. System will provide \ncomparative report of Technical Bid only. As it’s a subjective matter technical \nevaluation required to be carried out by departments. Subsequently, the \ncommercial bids of the technically qualified suppliers shall be opened for \nevaluation. After the commercial evaluation, Digitally Signed LOI will be \nawarded to the successful supplier. At every stage of the tender, the tender \ninitiator, approvers and the suppliers can remain informed about the status of \nthe tender through tender status bar.  \n \n4.5 If need be, suppliers can submit Technical Bid and Price Bid separately \ndigitally signed and can send it to the purchase department. Price bid can be \nopened only after evaluation of Technical Bid and only for those suppliers \nwho are technically qualified. \n \n \n10\n4.6 Another useful feature supported is online negotiations /reverse auction \nkeeping other terms such as Payment, Delivery etc. frozen. This will create a \nhealthy competition amongst suppliers to bid low. Also, vendors cannot form \na cartel to quote high rates because in online negotiations identity of vendors \nis hidden from each other. All the vendors will digitally sign their final bids. \n \n4.7 Similarly for disposal of scrap and surplus goods forward auction can be \nconducted where in vendors will bid online to buy the items under auction. \nOnline EMD payment will be provided. \n \n5.0 Security \n \nThe security is implemented both at the level of content and payments. The \nfollowing security features are integral part of (n)Procure: \n \n\u0001 Usage of legally valid class of Digital Signature Certificate under guide \nline of Indian IT Act 2000 (issued by Licensed Certifying Authority) for \nAuthentication and Non-repudiation at all levels. \n\u0001 Usage of Time Stamping services. \n\u0001 128-bit encryption with SSL security or equivalent. \n\u0001 Access to sensitive content such as price bid based solely on authorization. \n\u0001 Rights allocation such that it ensures only authorized personnel to perform \ntasks such as tender floating, bidding, opening, etc. \n\u0001 Biometric access can be provided for sensitive transactions of Tender \nOpening and LOI issuance. (Department should have compatible \nBiometric device to use this feature) \n\u0001 Complete compliance to IT Act 2000 for legal sanctity \n \n6.0 Payment System  \n \n(n)Procure supports the following payment mechanism:- \n \nProvision for on-line payment acceptance by integrating online \npayment gateway. \n \n \n \n \n \nFollowing banks can cater facility of online payment gateway. \n1. State Bank of India \n2. Bank of India \n3. Union Bank of India \n4. Punjab National Bank \n5. UTI \n6. HDFC \n7. ICICI \n8. Centurion Bank of Punjab  \n \nSecurity by the way of usage of SSL Certificate and Digital Signature \nCertificate \n \n11\n \n7.0 Reporting \n \n(n)Procure supports various report generations at different stages. These \nreports help in analyzing the buying pattern of a particular department. \n  \n• Statistics of Purchase activities \n• Department-wise tender / expenditure analysis \n• Item / category wise reporting  \n• Vendor-wise reports \n• Tender Accounting management system \n• Annual report on tendering \n \n8.0 Audit Log \n \nThe e-Procurement solution must have comprehensive audit log facility for \ndetailed auditing on all the transactions on the e-Procurement solution. The \nsolution should have secure, temper proof logging and auditing features. All \nthe information generated within the system must be capable of being \ndocumented for audit purposes to form an Audit Trail. The Audit Trail must \nbe configurable to meet individual organization requirements. The system \nmust be able to log all the activities, up to field level, carried out on the system \nby any user. It must not be possible to alter Audit Trail information using the \nsystem or other utilities and audit trail must be printable based on time period, \ntype of transaction etc. The detailed transaction log report should be submitted \nto core team of each Govt. Organizations who have implemented e-\nProcurement solution for each tender. \n \n9.0    Benefits of implementing e-Procurement \n \n9.1 Benefits to the organization implementing e-Procurement \nFast and efficient process reduces the procurement cycle time. \n \n9.2 The complete procurement transaction through the e-Procurement system \nhappens in a transparent manner. The system captures the justification and \ncomments of approvers at every stage and thereby enables users and approvers \nassociated with a transaction to justify their decision. \n  \n9.3 Encryption ensures integrity of the bid submitted. Immediate gains can be \nmade by saving on the cost of publishing the NIT in the newspapers, as all the \ntenders can now be intimated via e-mail in case of registered users as well as \npublished on the procurement web-application. \n \n9.4 Reverse auctions can enable the departments to negotiate better rates from \nits suppliers. \n \n9.5    e-Procurement brings down the cost of doing business for the \nsuppliers. This in turn will translate into reduction in prices by suppliers.  \n \n9.6  e-Procurement facilitates real time tracking of purchase order/delivery \nschedule status thereby enabling better planning of inventory. It drives process \n \n12\nefficiencies and results in reduction in the turnaround time for a tender and/or \na purchase order, again resulting in reduction in the inventory required to be \nmaintained at the users end, thereby resulting in reduction in cost.  \n \n9.7 e-Procurement enables a centralized database of procurement at all the \nproject sites, thereby aggregating the requirement of similar items across \nlocations. It results in increased purchasing power to negotiate better prices \nfrom suppliers. \n \n9.8 e-Procurement by making the procurement process paperless helps in \nreducing stationery and warehousing cost significantly.  \n \n9.9 The system inspires confidence among suppliers as being fair and \ntransparent.  \n \n9.10 Few more advantages of e-Procurement are as mentioned below: \n \nOff line Tendering  \nOnline Tendering \nBuyer Needs to publish detailed \nNotice Inviting Tender in Leading \nDailies i.e. detailed notice - cost \nmore.  \nPublish Brief Notice Inviting Tender and \ninterested parties can see the details \nonline along with tender documents to \nrefer. \nNeed to publish tender document \nas the bidder is going to submit \nthe tender in hardcopy \nNo Need to Publish Tender Document as \nbidder can view the tender docs online \nand submit the bids also online. \nAny amendment / corrigendum in \nthe tender needs to be published \nin the leading dailies \nWith e-Procurement buyer can issue any \nno. of amendment  online at no additional \ncharges \nWastage of Paper \nComplete Paperless  & Environment \nFriendly System \n \n \n9.11   Benefit of e-Procurement for Suppliers/Contractors: \n \n9.11.1 Information on all the tenders is available at one place to the suppliers.  \n9.11.2 Reduction in the transaction cost as the requirement of unnecessary \ntrips to the organization and communication to find the required information \ngets eliminated. \n9.11.3 Reduction in stationery cost as the supplier/contractor no longer needs \nto submit bulky multiple copies of his bid in the paper form. Also he can \nsubmit the bid from his office and need not visit the department for bid \nsubmission. \n9.11.4    s24X7 access enables the vendor to fill in the tender or access of \ntender status anytime, from anywhere. \nAfter online bid submission, the supplier/contractor can know the status of his \nbid online.  \n9.11.5 e-Procurement system allows the supplier/contractor to modify his bid \neven after the bid is submitted online. However, the bid modification facility is \navailable to the supplier/contractor only till the tender bid submission closing \ntime specified by the department.  \n \n13\n9.11.6 Increased reach as the supplier has access to all the procurement \nrequests of all the departments on the e-Procurement. This leads to reduction \nin sales and promotion costs for the supplier. \n9.11.7 Lower vendor development cost as various departments will have new \nsuppliers registered on the web application. \n \n10.0  Roles & Responsibilities \n \n10.1  Role of (n)Code Solutions \nApplication Software \n \n(n)Code Solutions offers the services of the application Software on ASP basis \nfor the e-Procurement process.

(pki is public key infrastructure – name given to set of policies, procedures, infrastructure and law to handle electronic signatures and verification thereof.) (n)procure enables the organization to implement the tendering process online from the “raising of indent to the placement of loi (including reverse auction if required)”. (n)procure is a one stop end to end solution for the entire e- procurement activity. 3.0 features of e-procurement • government officials (users) registration and right allocation. • vendor registration & pre qualification. • indent creation and approval. • estimated cost value (ecv) . • tender document management. • tender creation and approval. • tender publishing. • tender promotion via e-mail alerts. • issue of corrigendum. • online / offline sale of tender schedule. • conduction of online pre bid meeting. • online bid submission by vendors (facility for 2 bid / multiple bid system). • online automated bid comparatives (technical and commercial). • online negotiations. • award of loi . • reverse auction / forward auction. • rate contract management. • purchase statistics. • site access reports / web statistics. • encryption of bids submitted by the vendor (by the public key of the tender issuing authority). 4.0 process flow of e-procurement 4.1 once indent is approved, digitally signed tender can be published on the website with the facility to download the complete tender documents by the prospective vendors. payment of the tender fees can be achieved through online payment gateway. the tender documents can be simultaneously sold offline if the department desires so. however, the bids are required to be submitted online. 9 (n)procure also provides the facility to amend the tender (if required), extend the tender issue date etc. all such amendments have to be digitally signed by concerned authority. vendors who has selected department in his preference list, will be notified about such amendment / corrigendum through e-mail. 4.2 after downloading the tender documents vendors can submit their bids. these bids will be digitally signed and encrypted. the encryption will be done using public key of the tender issuing authority. thus, privacy is ensured. required emd can be paid online. payment gateway is provided to accept online payment for following banks. 1. state bank of india. 2. bank of india. 3. union bank of india 4. punjab national bank 5. unit trust of india. 6. hdfc. 7. icici. 8. centurion bank of punjab. 4.3 all necessary documents (such as income tax registration, sales tax registration proof) can be scanned and submitted duly digitally signed as part of the bid. there will be department defined format, in which vendors will submit the bid. (to make the evaluation online). modification of the bid submitted by vendor (before tender closing date) is permitted. all such changes / modification will be digitally signed by the vendor. vendors can also track status of their bids. for example, in a tender if technical bid and price bids are required separately and technical bid is evaluated before opening price bid, vendor can know the comparative of technical bid. the status can be tracked online. 4.4 the offers received electronically will be stored in a time locked box which can only be opened by the authorized tender opening committee nominee on due date and time. the purchase department will, at the specified date and time, open the technical bids of all the suppliers and evaluate them. system will provide comparative report of technical bid only. as it’s a subjective matter technical evaluation required to be carried out by departments. subsequently, the commercial bids of the technically qualified suppliers shall be opened for evaluation. after the commercial evaluation, digitally signed loi will be awarded to the successful supplier. at every stage of the tender, the tender initiator, approvers and the suppliers can remain informed about the status of the tender through tender status bar. 4.5 if need be, suppliers can submit technical bid and price bid separately digitally signed and can send it to the purchase department. price bid can be opened only after evaluation of technical bid and only for those suppliers who are technically qualified. 10 4.6 another useful feature supported is online negotiations /reverse auction keeping other terms such as payment, delivery etc. frozen. this will create a healthy competition amongst suppliers to bid low. also, vendors cannot form a cartel to quote high rates because in online negotiations identity of vendors is hidden from each other. all the vendors will digitally sign their final bids. 4.7 similarly for disposal of scrap and surplus goods forward auction can be conducted where in vendors will bid online to buy the items under auction. online emd payment will be provided. 5.0 security the security is implemented both at the level of content and payments. the following security features are integral part of (n)procure: \u0001 usage of legally valid class of digital signature certificate under guide line of indian it act 2000 (issued by licensed certifying authority) for authentication and non-repudiation at all levels. \u0001 usage of time stamping services. \u0001 128-bit encryption with ssl security or equivalent. \u0001 access to sensitive content such as price bid based solely on authorization. \u0001 rights allocation such that it ensures only authorized personnel to perform tasks such as tender floating, bidding, opening, etc. \u0001 biometric access can be provided for sensitive transactions of tender opening and loi issuance.
