The portal hosts,\npublishes and executes thousands of tenders for all departments of Govt. of Gujarat.\nThe portal is enabled with end to end eProcurement application which handles\nWorks  &  Goods  Tenders,  Open  &  Limited  Tenders,  multi  currency  situations,\nmultistage evaluations, reverse and forward auctions. \nThe eProcurement system is designed in such a way that it overcomes any type of\nsystem malfunction in normal course of activities. The load testing / unit testing etc.,\nis done during the testing phase to make sure that the Government of Gujarat's\neProcurement system works smoothly. Regular auditing also ensures the security of\nthe  system for  connectivity,  data,  server  availability  etc., In spite  of  all  these\nmeasures, the system may fail due to one of more of the following reasons:\ni.\nInternet Bandwidth Failure\nii. System Failure \niii. Local Problems\niv. Other unforeseen events\nWe believe that the bid submission activity is more critical and important as other\nevents such as Publishing New Tenders, Bid opening may not be as much critical as\nBid submission. The Bid submission activities need to be performed by the Bidders in\ntime bound manner considering it's last submission date & time. The time lines  are\npredefined by the Tender Publishing Authority/Department. The decision taken will\nbe uniformly applicable for all stake holders of the system.\n(n)Procure – System Malfunction Procedure \n(Ver -1.0) Rel.Date:01/Jan/2021\n4 of 8\n(i) Internet/Bandwidth Failure:\nIf the eProcurement portal is not accessible to the users because of overall Internet\nfailure  due  to  some  major  faults  in  the  provided  Bandwidth  with  Server  or\nunderground cables/ satellites or failure due to the global Internet Service Providers,\nthe System Administrator in consultation with the tender inviting authority may\nextend the scheduled time for the specific tenders with respect to the governing\nrules. The System Administrator will judge based on the overall effect of the failure\nand the option given to the Tender Publishing Authority for extending the bid\nsubmission dates for bids that are due for submission during the failure period\nthrough the Corrigendum. The bidder will get automatic mails from the system\nrelating to the Corrigendum.\n(ii) System/Power failure:\nIf the system / connectivity fails due to unexpected hardware component failure,\nNetworking issues or major power failure or any unknown technical issue or even\nnatural  calamities  like  Earthquake,  Tsunami,  Cyclone,  flood  etc.,  the  System\nAdministrator  /  tender  inviting  authority  may  consider  this  as  an  emergency\nsituation and decision for further extending the eProcurement activities will be\ntaken in consultation with the Highest authority of the implementing agency.

The  bidders  /  users  are  advised  to  make  alternate  arrangements  to\novercome these kinds of local problems and submit their bids in time without fail. If\nthe individual’s Digital Signing Certificate is expired or not usable due to any reason\nrelated with the issuing authority and the bidder is not able to connect with the\neProcurement portal, this will not considered as the system malfunction. The bidder\nhas to rectify these kinds of problems well in time and submit the bids properly.\nBy analyzing traffic control, random check of data transmission etc., the system\nadministrator monitors the system functionality in regular and periodic intervals.\nThe server/system generated error reports are traced from the log and monitored\nregularly.
