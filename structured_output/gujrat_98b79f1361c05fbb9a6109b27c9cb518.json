INTRODUCTION\nPurpose\n1.1\nThe purpose of these Guidelines is to\ninform those carrying out a project that is\nfinanced in whole or in part by a loan from the\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (IBRD) or a credit or grant from\nthe International Development Association\n(IDA),1 of the policies that govern the\nprocurement of goods, works, and services\n(other than consultant services) 2 required for\nthe project. The Loan Agreement governs the\nlegal relationships between the Borrower and\nthe Bank, and the Guidelines are made\napplicable to procurement of goods and works\nfor the project, as provided in the agreement.\nThe rights and obligations of the Borrower and\nthe providers of goods and works for the\nproject are governed by the bidding3\ndocuments, and by the contracts signed by the\nBorrower with the providers of goods and\nworks, and not by these Guidelines or the Loan\nAgreements. No party other than the parties to\nthe Loan Agreement shall derive any rights\ntherefrom or have any claim to loan proceeds.\n1\n1 Procurement requirements of IBRD and IDA are identical,\nand references in these Guidelines to the Bank include both\nIBRD and IDA, and references to loans include IBRD Loans\nas well as IDA credits or grants and project preparation\nadvances (PPAs). References to Loan Agreement includes\nDevelopment Credit Agreement, Development Financing\nAgreement, Development Grant Agreement, and Project\nAgreement. References to “Borrower” include the recipient\nof an IDA Grant.\n2 References to “goods” and “works” in these Guidelines\ninclude related services such as transportation, insurance,\ninstallation, commissioning, training, and initial\nmaintenance. “Goods” includes commodities, raw material,\nmachinery, equipment, and industrial plant. The provisions\nof these Guidelines also apply to services which are bid and\ncontracted on the basis of performance of a measurable\nphysical output, such as drilling, mapping, and similar\noperations. These Guidelines do not refer to Consultants’\nservices, to which the current Guidelines: Selection and\nEmployment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers apply\n(referred to herein as Consultant Guidelines).\n3 For the purposes of these Guidelines, the words “bid” and\n“tender” shall have the same meaning.\nGeneral Considerations\n1.2\nThe responsibility for the\nimplementation of the project, and therefore for\nthe award and administration of contracts\nunder the project, rests with the Borrower.4 The\nBank, for its part, is required by its Articles of\nAgreement to “…ensure that the proceeds of\nany loan are used only for the purposes for\nwhich the loan was granted, with due attention\nto considerations of economy and efficiency\nand without regard to political or other non-\neconomic influences or considerations,”5 and it\nhas established detailed procedures for this\npurpose. While in practice the specific\nprocurement rules and procedures to be\nfollowed in the implementation of a project\ndepend on the circumstances of the particular\ncase, four considerations generally guide the\nBank’s requirements:\n(a)\nthe need for economy and efficiency in\nthe implementation of the project,\nincluding the procurement of the goods\nand works involved;\n(b)\nthe Bank’s interest in giving all eligible\nbidders from developed and\ndeveloping countries6 the same\ninformation and equal opportunity to\ncompete in providing goods and works\nfinanced by the Bank;\n(c)\nthe Bank’s interest in encouraging the\ndevelopment of domestic contracting\nand manufacturing industries in the\nborrowing country; and\n(d)\nthe importance of transparency in the\nprocurement process.\n2\n4 In some cases, the Borrower acts only as an intermediary,\nand the project is carried out by another agency or entity.\nReferences in these Guidelines to the Borrower include such\nagencies and entities, as well as Sub-Borrowers under on-\nlending arrangements.\n5 The Bank’s Articles of Agreement; Article III, Section 5(b)\nand IDA’s Articles of Agreement; Article V, Section 1(g).\n6 See para. 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8.\n1.3\nOpen competition is the basis for\nefficient public procurement. Borrowers shall\nselect the most appropriate method for the\nspecific procurement. In most cases,\nInternational Competitive Bidding (ICB),\nproperly administered, and with the allowance\nfor preferences for domestically manufactured\ngoods and, where appropriate, for domestic\ncontractors7 for works under prescribed\nconditions is the most appropriate method. In\nmost cases, therefore, the Bank requires its\nBorrowers to obtain goods, works and services\nthrough ICB open to eligible suppliers and\ncontractors.8 Section II of these Guidelines\ndescribes the procedures for ICB.\n1.4\nWhere ICB is not the most appropriate\nmethod of procurement, other methods of\nprocurement may be used. Section III describes\nthese other methods of procurement and the\ncircumstances under which their application\nwould be more appropriate. The particular\nmethods that may be followed for procurement\nunder a given project are provided for in the\nLoan Agreement. The specific contracts to be\nfinanced under the project, and their method of\nprocurement, consistent with the Loan\nAgreement, are specified in the Procurement\nPlan as indicated in paragraph 1.16 of these\nGuidelines.\nApplicability of Guidelines\n1.5\nThe procedures outlined in these\nGuidelines apply to all contracts for goods and\nworks financed in whole or in part from Bank\nloans.9 For the procurement of those contracts\nfor goods and works not financed from a Bank\nloan, the Borrower may adopt other\nprocedures. In such cases the Bank shall be\nsatisfied that the procedures to be used will\nfulfill the Borrower’s obligations to cause the\nproject to be carried out diligently and\n3\n7 For purposes of these Guidelines, “Contractor” refers only\nto a firm providing construction services.\n8 See para. 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8.\n9 This includes those cases where the Borrower employs a\nprocurement agent under para. 3.10.\nefficiently, and that the goods and works to be\nprocured:\n(a)\nare of satisfactory quality and are\ncompatible with the balance of the\nproject;\n(b)\nwill be delivered or completed in\ntimely fashion; and\n(c)\nare priced so as not to affect adversely\nthe economic and financial viability of\nthe project.\nEligibility\n1.6\nTo foster competition the Bank permits\nfirms and individuals from all countries to offer\ngoods, works, and services for Bank-financed\nprojects. Any conditions for participation shall\nbe limited to those that are essential to ensure\nthe firm’s capability to fulfill the contract in\nquestion.10\n1.7\nIn connection with any contract to be\nfinanced in whole or in part from a Bank loan,\nthe Bank does not permit a Borrower to deny\npre- or post-qualification to a firm for reasons\nunrelated to its capability and resources to\nsuccessfully perform the contract; nor does it\npermit a Borrower to disqualify any bidder for\nsuch reasons. Consequently, Borrowers should\ncarry out due diligence on the technical and\nfinancial qualifications of bidders to be assured\nof their capabilities in relation to the specific\ncontract. \n1.8\nAs exceptions to the foregoing:\n(a)\nFirms of a country or goods\nmanufactured in a country may be\nexcluded if, (i) as a matter of law or\nofficial regulation, the Borrower’s\ncountry prohibits commercial relations\nwith that country, provided that the\n4\n10 The Bank permits firms and individuals from Taiwan,\nChina, to offer goods, works, and services for Bank-financed\nprojects.\nBank is satisfied that such exclusion\ndoes not preclude effective competition\nfor the supply of goods or works\nrequired, or (ii) by an act of compliance\nwith a decision of the United Nations\nSecurity Council taken under Chapter\nVII of the Charter of the United\nNations, the Borrower’s country\nprohibits any import of goods from, or\npayments to, a particular country,\nperson, or entity. Where the Borrower's\ncountry prohibits payments to a\nparticular firm or for particular goods\nby such an act of compliance, that firm\nmay be excluded.\n(b)\nA firm which has been engaged by the\nBorrower to provide consulting services\nfor the preparation or implementation\nof a project, and any of its affiliates,\nshall be disqualified from subsequently\nproviding goods, works, or services\nresulting from or directly related to the\nfirm’s consulting services for such\npreparation or implementation. This\nprovision does not apply to the various\nfirms (consultants, contractors, or\nsuppliers) which together are\nperforming the contractor’s obligations\nunder a turnkey or design and build\ncontract.11\n(c)\nGovernment-owned enterprises in the\nBorrower’s country may participate\nonly if they can establish that they (i)\nare legally and financially autonomous,\n(ii) operate under commercial law, and\n(iii) are not dependent agencies of the\nBorrower or Sub-Borrower.12\n(d)\nA firm declared ineligible by the Bank\nin accordance with subparagraph (d) of\nparagraph 1.14 of these Guidelines\nshall be ineligible to be awarded a\n5\n11 See para. 2.5.\n12 Other than Force Account units, as permitted under para.\n3.8.\nBank-financed contract during the\nperiod of time determined by the Bank.\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive\nFinancing\n1.9\nThe Borrower may wish to proceed\nwith the initial steps of procurement before\nsigning the related Bank loan. In such cases, the\nprocurement procedures, including advertising,\nshall be in accordance with the Guidelines in\norder for the eventual contracts to be eligible\nfor Bank financing, and the Bank shall review\nthe process used by the Borrower. A Borrower\nundertakes such advance contracting at its own\nrisk, and any concurrence by the Bank with the\nprocedures, documentation, or proposal for\naward does not commit the Bank to make a\nloan for the project in question. If the contract is\nsigned, reimbursement by the Bank of any\npayments made by the Borrower under the\ncontract prior to loan signing is referred to as\nretroactive financing and is only permitted\nwithin the limits specified in the Loan\nAgreement.\nJoint Ventures\n1.10\nAny firm may bid independently or in\njoint venture confirming joint and several\nliability, either with domestic firms and/or with\nforeign firms, but the Bank does not accept\nconditions of bidding which require mandatory\njoint ventures or other forms of mandatory\nassociation between firms.\nBank Review\n1.11\nThe Bank reviews the Borrower’s\nprocurement procedures, documents, bid\nevaluations, award recommendations, and\ncontracts to ensure that the procurement\nprocess is carried out in accordance with the\nagreed procedures. These review procedures\nare described in Appendix 1. The Procurement\nPlan approved by the Bank13 shall specify the\nextent to which these review procedures shall\n6\n13 See paragraphs 1.16. \napply in respect of the different categories of\ngoods and works to be financed, in whole or in\npart, from the Bank loan.\nMisprocurement\n1.12\nThe Bank does not finance expenditures\nfor goods and works which have not been\nprocured in accordance with the agreed\nprovisions in the Loan Agreement and as\nfurther elaborated in the Procurement Plan.14 In\nsuch cases, the Bank will declare\nmisprocurement, and it is the policy of the Bank\nto cancel that portion of the loan allocated to\nthe goods and works that have been\nmisprocured. The Bank may, in addition,\nexercise other remedies provided for under the\nLoan Agreement. Even once the contract is\nawarded after obtaining a “no objection” from\nthe Bank, the Bank may still declare\nmisprocurement if it concludes that the “no\nobjection” was issued on the basis of\nincomplete, inaccurate, or misleading\ninformation furnished by the Borrower or the\nterms and conditions of the contract had been\nmodified without Bank’s approval.\nReferences to Bank\n1.13 \nIf the Borrower wishes to refer to the\nBank in procurement documents, the following\nlanguage shall be used:\n“(name of Borrower) has received (or in\nappropriate cases ‘has applied for’) a [loan]\nfrom the [International Bank for Reconstruction\nand Development] (the “Bank”) in an amount\nequivalent to USD toward the cost of (name of\nproject), and intends to apply a portion of the\nproceeds of this [loan] to eligible payments\nunder this contract. Payment by the Bank will\nbe made only at the request of (name of\nBorrower or designate) and upon approval by\nthe Bank, and will be subject, in all respects, to\nthe terms and conditions of the [Loan]\nAgreement. The [Loan] Agreement prohibits a\n7\n14 See paragraph 1.16.\nwithdrawal from the [Loan] Account for the\npurpose of any payment to persons or entities,\nor for any import of goods, if such payment or\nimport, to the knowledge of the Bank, is\nprohibited by a decision of the United Nations\nSecurity Council taken under Chapter VII of the\nCharter of the United Nations.15 No party other\nthan (name of Borrower) shall derive any rights\nfrom the Loan Agreement or have any claim to\nthe proceeds of the [loan].”16\nFraud and Corruption\n1.14\nIt is the Bank’s policy to require that\nBorrowers (including beneficiaries of Bank\nloans), as well as bidders, suppliers, and\ncontractors under Bank-financed contracts,\nobserve the highest standard of ethics during\nthe procurement and execution of such\ncontracts. In pursuance of this policy, the Bank:\n(a)\ndefines, for the purposes of this\nprovision, the terms set forth below as\nfollows:\n(i)\n“corrupt practice” means the\noffering, giving, receiving, or\nsoliciting, directly or indirectly,\nof any thing of value to\ninfluence the action of a public\nofficial17 in the procurement\nprocess or in contract\nexecution; \n(ii)\n“fraudulent practice” means a\nmisrepresentation or omission\nof facts in order to influence a\nprocurement process or the\nexecution of a contract;\n(iii)\n“collusive practices” means a\nscheme or arrangement\n8\n15 IBRD’s General Conditions Applicable to Loans and\nGuarantee Agreements; Article V; Section 5.01 and IDA’s\nGeneral Conditions Applicable to Development Credit\nAgreements; Article V; Section 5.01 \n16 Substitute “credit,” “International Development\nAssociation,” and “Credit Agreement,” as appropriate.\n17 Includes World Bank staff and employees of other\norganizations taking or reviewing procurement decisions.\nbetween two or more bidders,\nwith or without the knowledge\nof the Borrower, designed to\nestablish bid prices at artificial,\nnon-competitive levels;\n(iv)\n“coercive practices” means\nharming or threatening to\nharm, directly or indirectly,\npersons, or their property to\ninfluence their participation in\na procurement process, or affect\nthe execution of a contract.\n(b)\nwill reject a proposal for award if it\ndetermines that the bidder\nrecommended for award has, directly\nor through an agent, engaged in\ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or\ncoercive practices in competing for the\ncontract in question;\n(c)\nwill cancel the portion of the loan\nallocated to a contract if it determines\nat any time that representatives of the\nBorrower or of a beneficiary of the loan\nengaged in corrupt, fraudulent,\ncollusive, or coercive practices during\nthe procurement or the execution of\nthat contract, without the Borrower\nhaving taken timely and appropriate\naction satisfactory to the Bank to\nremedy the situation;\n(d)\nwill sanction a firm or individual,\nincluding declaring ineligible, either\nindefinitely or for a stated period of\ntime, to be awarded a Bank-financed\ncontract if it at any time determines\nthat the firm has, directly or through an\nagent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent,\ncollusive, or coercive practices in\ncompeting for, or in executing, a Bank-\nfinanced contract; and\n(e)\nwill have the right to require that a\nprovision be included in bidding\ndocuments and in contracts financed by\na Bank loan, a provision be included\n9\nrequiring bidders, suppliers and\ncontractors to permit the Bank to\ninspect their accounts and records and\nother documents relating to the bid\nsubmission and contract performance\nand to have them audited by auditors\nappointed by the Bank.\n1.15\nWith the specific agreement of the\nBank, a Borrower may introduce, into bid forms\nfor large contracts financed by the Bank, an\nundertaking of the bidder to observe, in\ncompeting for and executing a contract, the\ncountry’s laws against fraud and corruption\n(including bribery), as listed in the bidding\ndocuments.18 The Bank will accept the\nintroduction of such undertaking at the request\nof the Borrowing country, provided the\narrangements governing such undertaking are\nsatisfactory to the Bank.\nProcurement Plan\n1.16\nAs part of the preparation of the project\nthe Borrower shall prepare and, before loan\nnegotiations, furnish to the Bank for its\napproval, a Procurement Plan19 acceptable to\nthe Bank setting forth: (a) the particular\ncontracts for the goods, works, and/or services\nrequired to carry out the project during the\ninitial period of at least 18 months; (b) the\nproposed methods for procurement of such\ncontracts that are permitted under the Loan\nAgreement, and (c) the related Bank review\nprocedures.20 The Borrower shall update the\n10\n18 As an example, such an undertaking might read as\nfollows: “We undertake that, in competing for (and, if the\naward is made to us, in executing) the above contract, we\nwill strictly observe the laws against fraud and corruption\nin force in the country of the [Purchaser] [Employer], as\nsuch laws have been listed by the [Purchaser] [Employer] in\nthe bidding documents for this contract.” \n19 If the Project includes the selection of consulting services,\nthe Procurement Plan should also include the methods for\nselection of consulting services in accordance with the\nGuidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by\nWorld Bank Borrowers. The Bank will disclose the initial\nProcurement Plan to the public after the related loan has\nbeen approved; additional updates will be disclosed after\nthe Bank has approved them.\n20 See Appendix 1\nProcurement Plan annually or as needed\nthroughout the duration of the project. The\nBorrower shall implement the Procurement\nPlan in the manner in which it has been\napproved by the Bank.\nII. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVE\nBIDDING\nA. General\nIntroduction\n2.1\nThe objective of International\nCompetitive Bidding (ICB), as described in\nthese Guidelines, is to provide all eligible\nprospective bidders21 with timely and adequate\nnotification of a Borrower’s requirements and\nan equal opportunity to bid for the required\ngoods and works.\nType and Size of Contracts\n2.2\nThe bidding documents shall clearly\nstate the type of contract to be entered into and\ncontain the proposed contract provisions\nappropriate therefor. The most common types\nof contracts provide for payments on the basis\nof a lump sum, unit prices, reimbursable cost\nplus fees, or combinations thereof.\nReimbursable cost contracts are acceptable to\nthe Bank only in exceptional circumstances\nsuch as conditions of high risk or where costs\ncannot be determined in advance with\nsufficient accuracy. Such contracts shall include\nappropriate incentives to limit costs.\n2.3\nThe size and scope of individual\ncontracts will depend on the magnitude,\nnature, and location of the project. For projects\nrequiring a variety of goods and works,\nseparate contracts generally are awarded for the\nsupply and/or installation of different items of\nequipment and plant22 and for the works.\n11\n21 See para. 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.\n22 For purposes of these Guidelines, “plant” refers to\ninstalled equipment, as in a production facility.\n2.4\nFor a project requiring similar but\nseparate items of equipment or works, bids\nmay be invited under alternative contract\noptions that would attract the interest of both\nsmall and large firms, which could be allowed,\nat their option, to bid for individual contracts\n(slices) or for a group of similar contracts\n(package). All bids and combinations of bids\nshall be received by the same deadline and\nopened and evaluated simultaneously so as to\ndetermine the bid or combination of bids\noffering the lowest evaluated cost to the\nBorrower.23\n2.5\nIn certain cases the Bank may accept or\nrequire a turnkey contract under which the\ndesign and engineering, the supply and\ninstallation of equipment, and the construction\nof a complete facility or works are provided\nunder one contract. Alternatively, the Borrower\nmay remain responsible for the design and\nengineering, and invite bids for a single\nresponsibility contract for the supply and\ninstallation of all goods and works required for\nthe project component. Design and build, and\nmanagement contracting24 contracts are also\nacceptable where appropriate.25\nTwo-Stage Bidding\n2.6\nIn the case of turnkey contracts or\ncontracts for large complex facilities or works of\na special nature or complex information and\ncommunication technology, it may be\nundesirable or impractical to prepare complete\ntechnical specifications in advance. In such a\ncase, a two-stage bidding procedure may be\nused, under which first unpriced technical\n12\n23 See paras. 2.49-2.54 for the bid evaluation procedures.\n24 In construction, a management contractor usually does\nnot perform the work directly but contracts out and\nmanages the work of other contractors, taking on the full\nresponsibility and risk for price, quality, and timely\nperformance. Conversely, a construction manager is a\nconsultant for, or agent of, the Borrower, but does not take\non such risks. (If financed by the Bank, the services of the\nconstruction manager should be procured under the\nConsultant Guidelines. See footnote 2.)\n25 Also see paras. 3.14 and 3.15 for performance-based\ncontracting.\nproposals on the basis of a conceptual design or\nperformance specifications are invited, subject\nto technical as well as commercial clarifications\nand adjustments, to be followed by amended\nbidding documents26 and the submission of\nfinal technical proposals and priced bids in the\nsecond stage.\nNotification and Advertising\n2.7\nTimely notification of bidding\nopportunities is essential in competitive\nbidding. For projects that include ICB the\nBorrower is required to prepare and submit to\nthe Bank a draft General Procurement Notice.\nThe Bank will arrange for its publication in UN\nDevelopment Business online (UNDB online) and\nin the Development Gateway’s  dgMarket).27 The\nNotice shall contain information concerning the\nBorrower (or prospective Borrower), amount\nand purpose of the loan, scope of procurement\nunder ICB, and the name, telephone (or fax)\nnumber, and address of the Borrower’s agency\nresponsible for procurement and the address of\nthe Website where specific procurement notices\nwill be posted. If known, the scheduled date for\navailability of prequalification or bidding\ndocuments should be indicated. The related\nprequalification or bidding documents, as the\ncase may be, shall not be released to the public\nearlier than the date of publication of the\nGeneral Procurement Notice.\n2.8\nInvitations to prequalify or to bid, as\nthe case may be, shall be advertised as Specific\nProcurement Notices in at least one newspaper\nof national circulation in the Borrower’s\n13\n26 In revising the bidding documents in the second stage the\nBorrower should respect the confidentiality of the bidders’\ntechnical proposals used in the first stage, consistent with\nrequirements of transparency and intellectual property\nrights.\n27 UNDB is a publication of the United Nations.\nSubscription information is available from: Development\nBusiness, United Nations, GCPO Box 5850, New York, NY\n10163-5850, USA (Website: www.devbusiness.com; e-mail:\ndbsubscribe@un.org); Development Gateway Market is an\nelectronic portal of Development Gateway Foundation, 1889\nF Street, N.W.  Washington, DC 20006, USA (Website:\nwww.dgmarket.com).\ncountry (or in the official gazette, or in an\nelectronic portal with free access). Such\ninvitations shall also be published in UNDB\nonline and in dgMarket. Notification shall be\ngiven in sufficient time to enable prospective\nbidders to obtain prequalification or bidding\ndocuments and prepare and submit their\nresponses.28\nPrequalification of Bidders\n2.9\nPrequalification is usually necessary for\nlarge or complex works, or in any other\ncircumstances in which the high costs of\npreparing detailed bids could discourage\ncompetition, such as custom-designed\nequipment, industrial plant, specialized\nservices, some complex information and\ntechnology and contracts to be let under\nturnkey, design and build, or management\ncontracting. This also ensures that invitations to\nbid are extended only to those who have\nadequate capabilities and resources.\nPrequalification shall be based entirely upon\nthe capability and resources of prospective\nbidders to perform the particular contract\nsatisfactorily, taking into account their (a)\nexperience and past performance on similar\ncontracts, (b) capabilities with respect to\npersonnel, equipment, and construction or\nmanufacturing facilities, and (c) financial\nposition.29\n2.10\nThe invitation to prequalify for bidding\non specific contracts or groups of similar\ncontracts shall be advertised and notified as\ndescribed in paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8 above. The\nscope of the contract and a clear statement of\nthe requirements for qualification shall be sent\nto those who responded to the invitation. All\nsuch applicants that meet the specified criteria\nshall be allowed to bid. Borrowers shall inform\nall applicants of the results of prequalification.\nAs soon as prequalification is completed, the\nbidding documents shall be made available to\n14\n28 See para. 2.44.\n29 The Bank has prepared a Standard Prequalification\nDocument for use by its Borrowers, where appropriate.\nthe qualified prospective bidders. For\nprequalification for groups of contracts to be\nawarded over a period of time, a limit for the\nnumber or total value of awards to any one\nbidder may be made on the basis of the\nbidder’s resources. The list of prequalified firms\nin such instances shall be updated periodically.\nVerification of the information provided in the\nsubmission for prequalification shall be\nconfirmed at the time of award of contract, and\naward may be denied to a bidder that is judged\nto no longer have the capability or resources to\nsuccessfully perform the contract.\nB. Bidding Documents\nGeneral\n2.11\nThe bidding documents shall furnish\nall information necessary for a prospective\nbidder to prepare a bid for the goods and\nworks to be provided. While the detail and\ncomplexity of these documents may vary with\nthe size and nature of the proposed bid package\nand contract, they generally include: invitation\nto bid; instructions to bidders; form of bid; form\nof contract; conditions of contract, both general\nand special; specifications and drawings;\nrelevant technical data (including of geological\nand environmental nature); list of goods or bill\nof quantities; delivery time or schedule of\ncompletion; and necessary appendices, such as\nformats for various securities. The basis for bid\nevaluation and selection of the lowest\nevaluated bid shall be clearly outlined in the\ninstructions to bidders and/or the\nspecifications. If a fee is charged for the bidding\ndocuments, it shall be reasonable and reflect\nonly the cost of their printing and delivery to\nprospective bidders, and shall not be so high as\nto discourage qualified bidders. The Borrower\nmay use an electronic system to distribute\nbidding documents, provided that the Bank is\nsatisfied with the adequacy of such system. If\nbidding documents are distributed\nelectronically, the electronic system shall be\nsecure to avoid modifications to the bidding\ndocuments and shall not restrict the access of\nBidders to the bidding documents. Guidance on\n15\ncritical components of the bidding documents\nare given in the following paragraphs.\n2.12\nBorrowers shall use the appropriate\nStandard Bidding Documents (SBDs) issued by\nthe Bank with minimum changes, acceptable to\nthe Bank, as necessary to address project-\nspecific conditions. Any such changes shall be\nintroduced only through bid or contract data\nsheets, or through special conditions of\ncontract, and not by introducing changes in the\nstandard wording of the Bank’s SBDs. Where\nno relevant standard bidding documents have\nbeen issued, the Borrower shall use other\ninternationally recognized standard conditions\nof contract and contract forms acceptable to the\nBank.\nValidity of Bids and Bid Security\n2.13\nBidders shall be required to submit bids\nvalid for a period specified in the bidding\ndocuments which shall be sufficient to enable\nthe Borrower to complete the comparison and\nevaluation of bids, review the recommendation\nof award with the Bank (if required in the\nProcurement Plan), and obtain all the necessary\napprovals so that the contract can be awarded\nwithin that period.\n2.14\nBorrowers have the option of requiring\na bid security. When used, the bid security shall\nbe in the amount and form specified in the\nbidding documents30 and shall remain valid for\na period of four weeks beyond the validity\nperiod for the bids, in order to provide\nreasonable time for the Borrower to act if the\nsecurity is to be called. Bid security shall be\nreleased to unsuccessful bidders once the\ncontract has been signed with the winning\nbidder. In place of a bid security, the Borrower\nmay require bidders to sign a declaration\n16\n30 The format of the bid security shall be in accordance with\nthe standard bidding documents and shall be issued by a\nreputable bank or financial institution selected by the\nbidder. If the institution issuing the security is located\noutside the country of the Borrower, it shall have a\ncorrespondent financial institution located in the country of\nBorrower to make it enforceable.\naccepting that if they withdraw or modify their\nbids during the period of validity or they are\nawarded the contract and they fail to sign the\ncontract or to submit a performance security\nbefore the deadline defined in the bidding\ndocuments, the bidder will be suspended for a\nperiod of time from being eligible for bidding\nin any contract with the Borrower.\nLanguage\n2.15\nPrequalification and bidding\ndocuments and the bids shall be prepared in\none of the following languages, selected by the\nBorrower: English, French, or Spanish. The\ncontract signed with the winning bidder shall\nbe written in the language so selected for the\nbidding documents, and this language shall be\nthe one that governs the contractual relations\nbetween the Borrower and the winning bidder.\nIn addition to being prepared in English,\nFrench, or Spanish, the prequalification and\nbidding documents may, at the Borrower’s\noption, also be prepared in the national\nlanguage of the Borrower’s country (or the\nlanguage used nation-wide in the borrower’s\ncountry for commercial transactions).31 If the\nprequalification and bidding documents are\nprepared in two languages, bidders shall be\npermitted to submit their bids in either of these\ntwo languages. In such case, the contract signed\nwith the winning bidder shall be written in the\nlanguage in which its bid was submitted, in\nwhich case this language shall be the one that\ngoverns the contractual relations between the\nBorrower and the winning bidder. If the\ncontract is signed in a language other than\nEnglish, French, or Spanish, and the contract is\nsubject to Bank’s prior review, the Borrower\nshall provide the Bank with a translation of the\ncontract in the internationally used language in\nwhich the bidding documents were prepared.\nBidders shall not be required nor permitted to\nsign contracts in two languages.\n17\n31 The Bank shall be satisfied with the language to be used. \nClarity of Bidding Documents\n2.16\nBidding documents shall be so worded\nas to permit and encourage international\ncompetition and shall set forth clearly and\nprecisely the work to be carried out, the\nlocation of the work, the goods to be supplied,\nthe place of delivery or installation, the\nschedule for delivery or completion, minimum\nperformance requirements, and the warranty\nand maintenance requirements, as well as any\nother pertinent terms and conditions. In\naddition, the bidding documents, where\nappropriate, shall define the tests, standards,\nand methods that will be employed to judge the\nconformity of equipment as delivered, or works\nas performed, with the specifications. Drawings\nshall be consistent with the text of the\nspecifications, and an order of precedence\nbetween the two shall be specified.\n2.17\nThe bidding documents shall specify\nany factors, in addition to price, which will be\ntaken into account in evaluating bids, and how\nsuch factors will be quantified or otherwise\nevaluated. If bids based on alternative designs,\nmaterials, completion schedules, payment\nterms, etc., are permitted, conditions for their\nacceptability and the method of their evaluation\nshall be expressly stated.\n2.18\nAll prospective bidders shall be\nprovided the same information, and shall be\nassured of equal opportunities to obtain\nadditional information on a timely basis.\nBorrowers shall provide reasonable access to\nproject sites for visits by prospective bidders.\nFor works or complex supply contracts,\nparticularly for those requiring refurbishing\nexisting works or equipment, a pre-bid\nconference may be arranged whereby potential\nbidders may meet with the Borrower\nrepresentatives to seek clarifications (in person\nor online). Minutes of the conference shall be\n18\nprovided to all prospective bidders with a copy\nto the Bank (in hard copy or sent electronically).\nAny additional information, clarification,\ncorrection of errors, or modifications of bidding\ndocuments shall be sent to each recipient of the\noriginal bidding documents in sufficient time\nbefore the deadline for receipt of bids to enable\nbidders to take appropriate actions. If\nnecessary, the deadline shall be extended. The\nBank shall receive a copy (in hard copy format\nor sent electronically) and be consulted for\nissuing a “no objection” when the contract is\nsubject to prior review.\nStandards\n2.19\nStandards and technical specifications\nquoted in bidding documents shall promote the\nbroadest possible competition, while assuring\nthe critical performance or other requirements\nfor the goods and/or works under\nprocurement. As far as possible, the Borrower\nshall specify internationally accepted standards\nsuch as those issued by the International\nStandards Organization with which the\nequipment or materials or workmanship shall\ncomply. Where such international standards are\nunavailable or are inappropriate, national\nstandards may be specified. In all cases, the\nbidding documents shall state that equipment,\nmaterial, or workmanship meeting other\nstandards, which promise at least substantial\nequivalence, will also be accepted.\nUse of Brand Names\n2.20\nSpecifications shall be based on\nrelevant characteristics and/or performance\nrequirements. References to brand names,\ncatalog numbers, or similar classifications shall\nbe avoided. If it is necessary to quote a brand\nname or catalog number of a particular\nmanufacturer to clarify an otherwise\nincomplete specification, the words “or\n19\nequivalent” shall be added after such reference.\nThe specification shall permit the acceptance of\noffers for goods which have similar\ncharacteristics and which provide performance\nat least substantially equivalent to those\nspecified.\nPricing\n2.21\nBids for goods shall be invited on the\nbasis of CIP32 (place of destination) for all\ngoods manufactured abroad, including those\npreviously imported, and EXW33 (ex works, ex\nfactory, or off-the-shelf) plus cost of inland\ntransportation and insurance to the place of\ndestination for goods manufactured or\nassembled in the country of the Borrower.\nBidders shall be allowed to arrange for ocean\nand other transportation and related insurance\nfrom any eligible source.34 Where installation,\ncommissioning, or other similar services are\nrequired to be performed by the bidder, as in\nthe case of “supply and installation” contracts,\nthe bidder shall be required to quote for these\nservices, in addition.\n2.22\nIn the case of turnkey contracts, the\nbidder shall be required to quote the price of\nthe installed plant at site, including all costs for\nsupply of equipment, marine and local\n20\n32 Refer to INCOTERMS 2000 for further definitions.\nPublished by the International Chamber of Commerce, 38\nCours Albert 1er, 75008 Paris, France. CIP is carriage and\ninsurance paid to (named place of destination). This term\nmay be used irrespective of the mode of transport, including\nmultimodal transport. CIP term is for custom duties and\nother import taxes unpaid, payment for which is the\nresponsibility of the Borrower, either for goods previously\nimported or that will be imported. For previously imported\ngoods, the quoted CIP price shall be distinguishable from\nthe original import value of these goods declared to customs\nand shall include any rebate or mark-up of the local agent or\nrepresentative and all local costs except import duties and\ntaxes, which will be paid by the purchaser.\n33 The EXW price shall include all duties, sales, and other\ntaxes already paid or payable for the components and raw\nmaterials used in the manufacture or assembly of the\nequipment, offered in the bid.\n34 See para. 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.\ntransportation and insurance, installation, and\ncommissioning, as well as associated works and\nall other services included in the scope of\ncontract such as design, maintenance,\noperation, etc. Unless otherwise specified in the\nbidding documents, the turnkey price shall\ninclude all duties, taxes, and other levies.35\n2.23\nBidders for works contracts shall be\nrequired to quote unit prices or lump sum\nprices for the performance of the works, and\nsuch prices shall include all duties, taxes, and\nother levies. Bidders shall be allowed to obtain\nall inputs (except for unskilled labor) from any\neligible source so that they may offer their most\ncompetitive bids.\nPrice Adjustment\n2.24\nBidding documents shall state either\nthat (a) bid prices will be fixed or (b) that price\nadjustments will be made to reflect any changes\n(upwards or downwards) in major cost\ncomponents of the contract, such as labor,\nequipment, materials, and fuel. Price\nadjustment provisions are usually not necessary\nin simple contracts involving delivery of goods\nor completion of works within eighteen\nmonths, but shall be included in contracts\nwhich extend beyond eighteen months.\nHowever, it is normal commercial practice to\nobtain firm prices for some types of equipment\nregardless of the delivery time and, in such\ncases, price adjustment provisions are not\nneeded.\n2.25\nPrices may be adjusted by the use of a\nprescribed formula (or formulae) which breaks\ndown the total price into components that are\nadjusted by price indices specified for each\ncomponent or, alternatively, on the basis of\ndocumentary evidence (including actual\ninvoices) provided by the supplier or\ncontractor. The use of the formula method of\n21\n35 Goods in bids for turnkey contracts may be invited on the\nbasis of DDP (named place of destination) and Bidders\nshould be free to choose the best arrangement between\nimported goods or goods manufactured in the country of\nthe Borrower, in the preparation of their bids. \nprice adjustment is preferable to that of\ndocumentary evidence. The method to be used,\nthe formula (if applicable), and the base date\nfor application shall be clearly defined in the\nbidding documents. If the payment currency is\ndifferent from the source of the input and\ncorresponding index, a correction factor shall\nbe applied in the formula, to avoid incorrect\nadjustment.\nTransportation and Insurance\n2.26\nBidding documents shall permit\nsuppliers and contractors to arrange\ntransportation and insurance from any eligible\nsource. Bidding documents shall state the types\nand terms of insurance to be provided by the\nbidder. The indemnity payable under\ntransportation insurance shall be at least 110\npercent of the contract amount in the currency\nof the contract or in a freely convertible\ncurrency to enable prompt replacement of lost\nor damaged goods. For works, a contractor’s\nAll Risk form of policy usually shall be\nspecified. For large projects with several\ncontractors on a site, a “wrap-up” or total\nproject insurance arrangement may be obtained\nby the Borrower, in which case the Borrower\nshall seek competition for such insurance.\n2.27\nAs an exception, if a Borrower wishes\nto reserve transportation and insurance for the\nimport of goods to national companies or other\ndesignated sources, bidders shall be asked to\nquote FCA (named place) or CPT (named place\nof destination)36 prices in addition to the CIP\n(place of destination) price specified in\nparagraph 2.21. Selection of the lowest\nevaluated bid shall be on the basis of the CIP\n(place of destination) price, but the Borrower\nmay sign the contract on FCA or CPT terms and\nmake its own arrangement for transportation\nand/or insurance. Under such circumstances,\nthe contract shall be limited to the FCA or CPT\ncost. If the Borrower does not wish to obtain\n22\n36 INCOTERMS 2000 for free carrier (named place) and for\ncarriage paid to (named place of destination), respectively.\ninsurance coverage in the market, evidence\nshall be provided to the Bank that resources are\nreadily available for prompt payment in a\nfreely convertible currency of the indemnities\nrequired to replace lost or damaged goods.\nCurrency Provisions\n2.28\nBidding documents shall state the\ncurrency or currencies in which bidders are to\nstate their prices, the procedure for conversion\nof prices expressed in different currencies into a\nsingle currency for the purpose of comparing\nbids, and the currencies in which the contract\nprice will be paid. The following provisions\n(paragraphs 2.29-2.33) are intended to (a)\nensure that bidders have the opportunity to\nminimize any exchange risk with regard to the\ncurrency of bid and of payment, and hence may\noffer their best prices; (b) give bidders in\ncountries with weak currencies the option to\nuse a stronger currency and thus provide a\nfirmer basis for their bid price; and (c) ensure\nfairness and transparency in the evaluation\nprocess.\nCurrency of Bid\n2.29\nBidding documents shall state that the\nbidder may express the bid price in any\ncurrency. If the bidder wishes to express the bid\nprice as a sum of amounts in different foreign\ncurrencies, they may do so, provided the price\nincludes no more than three foreign currencies.\nFurthermore, the Borrower may require bidders\nto state the portion of the bid price representing\nlocal costs incurred in the currency37 of the\ncountry of the Borrower.\n2.30\nIn bidding documents for works, the\nBorrower may require bidders to state the bid\nprice entirely in the local currency, along with\nthe requirements for payments in up to three\nforeign currencies of their choice for expected\ninputs from outside the Borrower’s country,\nexpressed as a percentage of the bid price,\n23\n37 Referred to hereafter as local currency.\ntogether with the exchange rates used in such\ncalculations.\nCurrency Conversion for Bid Comparison\n2.31\nThe bid price is the sum of all\npayments in various currencies required by the\nbidder. For the purpose of comparing prices,\nbid prices shall be converted to a single\ncurrency selected by the Borrower (local\ncurrency or fully convertible foreign currency)\nand stated in the bidding documents. The\nBorrower shall make this conversion by using\nthe selling (exchange) rates for those currencies\nquoted by an official source (such as the Central\nBank) or by a commercial bank or by an\ninternationally circulated newspaper for similar\ntransactions on a date selected in advance, such\nsource and date to be specified in the bidding\ndocuments, provided that the date shall not be\nearlier than four weeks prior to the deadline for\nthe receipt of bids, nor later than the original\ndate for the expiry of the period of bid validity.\nCurrency of Payment\n2.32\nPayment of the contract price shall be\nmade in the currency or currencies in which the\nbid price is expressed in the bid of the\nsuccessful bidder.\n2.33\nWhen the bid price is required to be\nstated in the local currency but the bidder has\nrequested payment in foreign currencies\nexpressed as a percentage of the bid price, the\nexchange rates to be used for purposes of\npayments shall be those specified by the bidder\nin the bid, so as to ensure that the value of the\nforeign currency portions of the bid is\nmaintained without any loss or gain.\nTerms and Methods of Payment\n2.34\nPayment terms shall be in accordance\nwith the international commercial practices\napplicable to the specific goods and works.\n(a)\nContracts for supply of goods shall\nprovide for full payment on the\ndelivery and inspection, if so required,\nof the contracted goods except for\n24\ncontracts involving installation and\ncommissioning, in which case a portion\nof the payment may be made after the\nSupplier has complied with all its\nobligations under the contract. The use\nof letters of credit is encouraged so as\nto assure prompt payment to the\nsupplier. In major contracts for\nequipment and plant, provision shall be\nmade for suitable advances and, in\ncontracts of long duration, for progress\npayments during the period of\nmanufacture or assembly.\n(b)\nContracts for works shall provide in\nappropriate cases for mobilization\nadvances, advances on contractor’s\nequipment and materials, regular\nprogress payments, and reasonable\nretention amounts to be released upon\ncompliance with the Contractor’s\nobligations under contract.\n2.35\nAny advance payment for mobilization\nand similar expenses, made upon signature of a\ncontract for goods or works, shall be related to\nthe estimated amount of these expenses and be\nspecified in the bidding documents. Amounts\nand timing of other advances to be made, such\nas for materials delivered to the site for\nincorporation in the works, shall also be\nspecified. The bidding documents shall specify\nthe arrangements for any security required for\nadvance payments.\n2.36\nBidding documents shall specify the\npayment method and terms offered, whether\nalternative payment methods and terms will be\nallowed and, if so, how the terms will affect bid\nevaluation.\nAlternative Bids\n2.37\nThe bidding documents shall clearly\nindicate when bidders are allowed to submit\nalternative bids, how alternative bids should be\nsubmitted, how bid prices should be offered\nand the basis on which alternative bids shall be\nevaluated.\n25\nConditions of Contract\n2.38\nThe contract documents shall clearly\ndefine the scope of work to be performed, the\ngoods to be supplied, the rights and obligations\nof the Borrower and of the supplier or\ncontractor, and the functions and authority of\nthe engineer, architect, or construction manager,\nif one is employed by the Borrower, in the\nsupervision and administration of the contract.\nIn addition to the general conditions of\ncontract, any special conditions particular to the\nspecific goods or works to be procured and the\nlocation of the project shall be included. The\nconditions of contract shall provide a balanced\nallocation of risks and liabilities.\nPerformance Security\n2.39\nBidding documents for works shall\nrequire security in an amount sufficient to\nprotect the Borrower in case of breach of\ncontract by the Contractor. This security shall\nbe provided in an appropriate form and\namount, as specified by the Borrower in the\nbidding document.38 The amount of the\nsecurity may vary, depending on the type of\nsecurity furnished and on the nature and\nmagnitude of the works. A portion of this\nsecurity shall extend sufficiently beyond the\ndate of completion of the works to cover the\ndefects liability or maintenance period up to\nfinal acceptance by the Borrower; alternatively,\ncontracts may provide for a percentage of each\nperiodic payment to be held as retention money\nuntil final acceptance. Contractors may be\nallowed to replace retention money with an\nequivalent security after provisional acceptance.\n2.40\nIn contracts for the supply of goods, the\nneed for performance security depends on the\nmarket conditions and commercial practice for\nthe particular kind of goods. Suppliers or\n26\n38 The format of the performance security shall be in\naccordance with the standard bidding documents and shall\nbe issued by a reputable bank or financial institution\nselected by the bidder. If the institution issuing the security\nis located outside the country of the Borrower, it shall have\na correspondent financial institution located in the country\nof Borrower to make it enforceable.\nmanufacturers may be required to provide a\nguarantee to protect against nonperformance of\nthe contract. Such security in an appropriate\namount may also cover warranty obligations or,\nalternatively, a percentage of the payments may\nbe held as retention money to cover warranty\nobligations, and any installation or\ncommissioning requirements. The security or\nretention money shall be reasonable in amount.\nLiquidated Damages and Bonus Clauses\n2.41\nProvisions for liquidated damages or\nsimilar provisions in an appropriate amount\nshall be included in the conditions of contract\nwhen delays in the delivery of goods,\ncompletion of works or failure of the goods or\nworks to meet performance requirements\nwould result in extra cost, or loss of revenue or\nloss of other benefits to the Borrower. Provision\nmay also be made for a bonus to be paid to\nsuppliers or contractors for completion of\nworks or delivery of goods ahead of the times\nspecified in the contract when such earlier\ncompletion or delivery would be of benefit to\nthe Borrower.\nForce Majeure\n2.42\nThe conditions of contract shall\nstipulate that failure on the part of the parties\nto perform their obligations under the contract\nwill not be considered a default if such failure\nis the result of an event of force majeure as\ndefined in the conditions of contract.\nApplicable Law and Settlement of\nDisputes\n2.43\nThe conditions of contract shall include\nprovisions dealing with the applicable law and\nthe forum for the settlement of disputes.\nInternational commercial arbitration has\npractical advantages over other methods for the\nsettlement of disputes. Therefore, the Bank\n27\nrecommends that Borrowers use this type of\narbitration in contracts for the procurement of\ngoods and works. The Bank shall not be named\narbitrator or be asked to name an arbitrator.39\nIn case of works contracts, supply and\ninstallation contracts, and turnkey contracts, the\ndispute settlement provision shall also include\nmechanisms such as dispute review boards or\nadjudicators, which are designed to permit a\nspeedier dispute settlement.\nC. Bid Opening, Evaluation, and\nAward of Contract\nTime for Preparation of Bids\n2.44\nThe time allowed for the preparation\nand submission of bids shall be determined\nwith due consideration of the particular\ncircumstances of the project and the magnitude\nand complexity of the contract. Generally, not\nless than six weeks from the date of the\ninvitation to bid or the date of availability of\nbidding documents, whichever is later, shall be\nallowed for ICB. Where large works or complex\nitems of equipment are involved, this period\nshall generally be not less than twelve weeks to\nenable prospective bidders to conduct\ninvestigations before submitting their bids. In\nsuch cases, the Borrower is encouraged to\nconvene pre-bid conferences and arrange site\nvisits. Bidders shall be permitted to submit bids\nby mail or by hand. Borrowers may also use\nelectronic systems permitting bidders to submit\nbids by electronic means, provided the Bank is\nsatisfied with the adequacy of the system,\nincluding, inter alia, that the system is secure,\nmaintains the confidentiality and authenticity\nof bids submitted, uses an electronic signature\nsystem or equivalent to keep bidders bound to\ntheir bids, and only allows bids to be opened\nwith due simultaneous electronic authorization\nof the bidder and the Borrower. In this case,\n28\n39 It is understood, however, that officials of the\nInternational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\n(ICSID) shall remain free to name arbitrators in their\ncapacity as ICSID officials.\nbidders shall continue to have the option to\nsubmit their bids in hard copy. The deadline\nand place for receipt of bids shall be specified\nin the invitation to bid.\nBid Opening Procedures\n2.45\nThe time for the bid opening shall be\nthe same as for the deadline for receipt of bids\nor promptly40 thereafter, and shall be\nannounced, together with the place for bid\nopening, in the invitation to bid. The Borrower\nshall open all bids at the stipulated time and\nplace. Bids shall be opened in public; bidders or\ntheir representatives shall be allowed to be\npresent (in person or online, when electronic\nbidding is used). The name of the bidder and\ntotal amount of each bid, and of any alternative\nbids if they have been requested or permitted,\nshall be read aloud (and posted online when\nelectronic bidding is used) and recorded when\nopened and a copy of this record shall be\npromptly sent to the Bank and to all bidders\nwho submitted bids in time. Bids received after\nthe time stipulated, as well as those not opened\nand read out at bid opening, shall not be\nconsidered.\nClarifications or Alterations of Bids\n2.46\nExcept as otherwise provided in\nparagraphs 2.63 and 2.64 of these Guidelines,\nbidders shall not be requested or permitted to\nalter their bids after the deadline for receipt of\nbids. The Borrower shall ask bidders for\nclarification needed to evaluate their bids but\nshall not ask or permit bidders to change the\nsubstance or price of their bids after the bid\nopening. Requests for clarification and the\nbidders’ responses shall be made in writing, in\nhard copy or by an electronic system\nsatisfactory to the Bank.41\nConfidentiality\n2.47\nAfter the public opening of bids,\ninformation relating to the examination,\n29\n40 To allow sufficient time to take the bids to the place\nannounced for public bid opening.\n41 See paragraph 2.44\nclarification, and evaluation of bids and\nrecommendations concerning awards shall not\nbe disclosed to bidders or other persons not\nofficially concerned with this process until the\npublication of contract award.\nExamination of Bids\n2.48\nThe Borrower shall ascertain whether\nthe bids (a) meet the eligibility requirements\nspecified in paragraph 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 of these\nGuidelines, (b) have been properly signed, (c)\nare accompanied by the required securities or\nrequired declaration signed as specified in\nparagraph 2.14 of the Guidelines, (d) are\nsubstantially responsive to the bidding\ndocuments, and (v) are otherwise generally in\norder. If a bid is not substantially responsive,\nthat is, it contains material deviations from or\nreservations to the terms, conditions, and\nspecifications in the bidding documents, it shall\nnot be considered further. The bidder shall not\nbe permitted to correct or withdraw material\ndeviations or reservations once bids have been\nopened.42\nEvaluation and Comparison of Bids\n2.49\nThe purpose of bid evaluation is to\ndetermine the cost to the Borrower of each bid\nin a manner that permits a comparison on the\nbasis of their evaluated cost. Subject to\nparagraph 2.58, the bid with the lowest\nevaluated cost,43 but not necessarily the lowest\nsubmitted price, shall be selected for award.\n2.50\nThe bid price read out at the bid\nopening shall be adjusted to correct any\narithmetical errors. Also, for the purpose of\nevaluation, adjustments shall be made for any\nquantifiable nonmaterial deviations or\nreservations. Price adjustment provisions\napplying to the period of implementation of the\ncontract shall not be taken into account in the\nevaluation.\n2.51\nThe evaluation and comparison of bids\nshall be on CIP (place of destination) prices for\n30\n42 See para. 2.50 regarding corrections.\n43 See para. 2.52.\nthe supply of imported goods44 and EXW\nprices, plus cost of inland transportation and\ninsurance to the place of destination, for goods\nmanufactured within the Borrower’s country,\ntogether with prices for any required\ninstallation, training, commissioning, and other\nsimilar services.45\n2.52\nBidding documents shall also specify\nthe relevant factors in addition to price to be\nconsidered in bid evaluation and the manner in\nwhich they will be applied for the purpose of\ndetermining the lowest evaluated bid. For\ngoods and equipment, other factors may be\ntaken into consideration including, among\nothers, payment schedule, delivery time,\noperating costs, efficiency and compatibility of\nthe equipment, availability of service and spare\nparts, and related training, safety, and\nenvironmental benefits. The factors other than\nprice to be used for determining the lowest\nevaluated bid shall, to the extent practicable, be\nexpressed in monetary terms, or given a\nrelative weight in the evaluation provisions in\nthe bidding documents. \n2.53\nUnder works and turnkey contracts,\ncontractors are responsible for all duties, taxes,\nand other levies,46 and bidders shall take these\nfactors into account in preparing their bids. The\nevaluation and comparison of bids shall be on\nthis basis. Bid evaluation for works shall be\nstrictly in monetary terms. Any procedure\nunder which bids above or below a\npredetermined assessment of bid values are\n31\n44 Borrowers may ask for prices on a CIF basis (and bids\ncompared on that same basis) only when the goods are\ncarried by sea and the goods are not containerized. CIF shall\nnot be used for anything other than sea transport. In the\ncase of manufactured goods, it is unlikely that the choice of\nCIF will be appropriate, because these goods are usually\ncontainerized. CIP can be used for any mode of transport,\nincluding sea and multimodal transport.\n45 The evaluation of bids shall not take into account: (a)\ncustoms duties and other taxes levied on imported goods\nquoted CIP (which are excluded of custom duties); (b) sales\nand similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or\ndelivery of the goods\n46 Unless bidding documents specify otherwise for some\nturnkey contracts (see para. 2.22 ).\nautomatically disqualified is not acceptable. If\ntime is a critical factor, the value of early\ncompletion to the Borrower may be taken into\naccount according to criteria presented in the\nbidding documents, only if the conditions of\ncontract provide for commensurate penalties\nfor noncompliance.\n2.54\nThe Borrower shall prepare a detailed\nreport on the evaluation and comparison of\nbids setting forth the specific reasons on which\nthe recommendation is based for the award of\nthe contract.\nDomestic Preferences\n2.55\nAt the request of the Borrower, and\nunder conditions to be agreed under the Loan\nAgreement and set forth in the bidding\ndocuments, a margin of preference may be\nprovided in the evaluation of bids for:\n(a)\ngoods manufactured in the country of\nthe Borrower when comparing bids\noffering such goods with those offering\ngoods manufactured abroad; and\n(b)\nworks in member countries below a\nspecified threshold of GNP47 per capita,\nwhen comparing bids from eligible\ndomestic Contractors with those from\nforeign firms.\n2.56\nWhere preference for domestically\nmanufactured goods or for domestic\nContractors is allowed, the methods and stages\nset forth in Appendix 2 to these Guidelines\nshall be followed in the evaluation and\ncomparison of bids.\nExtension of Validity of Bids\n2.57\nBorrowers shall complete evaluation of\nbids and award of contract within the initial\nperiod of bid validity so that extensions are not\nnecessary. An extension of bid validity, if\njustified by exceptional circumstances, shall be\nrequested in writing from all bidders before the\nexpiration date. The extension shall be for the\n32\n47 Gross national product as defined annually by the Bank.\nminimum period required to complete the\nevaluation, obtain the necessary approvals, and\naward the contract. In the case of fixed price\ncontracts, requests for second and subsequent\nextensions will be permissible only if the\nrequest for extension provides for an\nappropriate adjustment mechanism of the\nquoted price to reflect changes in the cost of\ninputs for the contract over the period of\nextension. Whenever an extension of bid\nvalidity period is requested, bidders shall not\nbe requested or be permitted to change the\nquoted (base) price or other conditions of their\nbid. Bidders shall have the right to refuse to\ngrant such an extension. If the bidding\ndocuments require a bid security, bidders may\nexercise their right to refuse to grant such an\nextension without forfeiting their bid security,\nbut those who are willing to extend the validity\nof their bid shall be required to provide a\nsuitable extension of bid security.\nPostqualification of Bidders\n2.58\nIf bidders have not been prequalified,\nthe Borrower shall determine whether the\nbidder whose bid has been determined to offer\nthe lowest evaluated cost has the capability and\nresources to effectively carry out the contract as\noffered in the bid. The criteria to be met shall be\nset out in the bidding documents, and if the\nbidder does not meet them, the bid shall be\nrejected. In such an event, the Borrower shall\nmake a similar determination for the next-\nlowest evaluated bidder.\nAward of Contract\n2.59\nThe Borrower shall award the contract,\nwithin the period of the validity of bids, to the\nbidder who meets the appropriate standards of\ncapability and resources and whose bid has\nbeen determined (i) to be substantially\nresponsive to the bidding documents and (ii) to\noffer the lowest evaluated cost.48 A bidder shall\nnot be required, as a condition of award, to\nundertake responsibilities for work not\n33\n48 Referred to as “lowest evaluated bidder” and “lowest\nevaluated bid,” respectively.\nstipulated in the bidding documents or\notherwise to modify the bid as originally\nsubmitted.\nPublication of the Award of Contract\n2.60\nWithin two weeks of receiving the\nBank’s “no objection” to the recommendation of\ncontract award, the Borrower shall publish in\nUNDB online and in dgMarket the results\nidentifying the bid and lot numbers and the\nfollowing information: (a) name of each bidder\nwho submitted a bid; (b) bid prices as read out\nat bid opening; (c) name and evaluated prices\nof each bid that was evaluated; (d) name of\nbidders whose bids were rejected and the\nreasons for their rejection; and (e) name of the\nwinning bidder, and the price it offered, as well\nas the duration and summary scope of the\ncontract awarded.\nRejection of All Bids\n2.61\nBidding documents usually provide\nthat Borrowers may reject all bids. Rejection of\nall bids is justified when there is lack of\neffective competition, or bids are not\nsubstantially responsive or when bid prices are\nsubstantially higher than existing budget. Lack\nof competition shall not be determined solely\non the basis of the number of bidders. Even\nwhen only one bid is submitted, the bidding\nprocess may be considered valid, if the bid was\nsatisfactorily advertised and prices are\nreasonable in comparison to market values.\nBorrowers may, after the Bank’s prior approval,\nreject all bids. If all bids are rejected, the\nBorrower shall review the causes justifying the\nrejection and consider making revisions to the\nconditions of contract, design and\nspecifications, scope of the contract, or a\ncombination of these, before inviting new bids.\n2.62\nIf the rejection of all bids is due to lack\nof competition, wider advertising shall be\nconsidered. If the rejection is due to most or all\nof the bids being nonresponsive, new bids may\nbe invited from the initially prequalified firms,\nor with the agreement of the Bank from only\nthose that submitted bids in the first instance.\n34\n2.63\nAll bids shall not be rejected and new\nbids invited on the same bidding and contract\ndocuments solely for the purpose of obtaining\nlower prices. If the lowest evaluated responsive\nbid exceeds the Borrower’s pre-bid cost\nestimates by a substantial margin, the Borrower\nshall investigate causes for the excessive cost\nand consider requesting new bids as described\nin the previous paragraphs. Alternatively, the\nBorrower may negotiate with the lowest\nevaluated bidder to try to obtain a satisfactory\ncontract through a reduction in the scope\nand/or a reallocation of risk and responsibility\nwhich can be reflected in a reduction of the\ncontract price. However, substantial reduction\nin the scope or modification to the contract\ndocuments may require rebidding.\n2.64\nThe Bank’s prior approval shall be\nobtained before rejecting all bids, soliciting new\nbids, or entering into negotiations with the\nlowest evaluated bidder.\nDebriefing\n2.65\nIn the publication of Contract Award\nreferred to in paragraph 2.60 the Borrower shall\nspecify that any bidder who wishes to ascertain\nthe grounds on which its bid was not selected,\nshould request an explanation from the\nBorrower. The Borrower shall promptly provide\nan explanation of why such bid was not\nselected, either in writing and/or in a\ndebriefing meeting, at the option of the\nBorrower. The requesting bidder shall bear all\nthe costs of attending such a debriefing. \nD. Modified ICB\nOperations Involving a Program of\nImports49\n2.66\nWhere the loan provides financing for a\nprogram of imports, ICB with simplified\nadvertising and currency provisions may be\n35\n49 Also see para. 3.11.\nused for large-value contracts, as defined in the\nLoan Agreement.50\n2.67\nThe simplified provisions for\nnotification of ICB procurement do not require\na General Procurement Notice. Specific\nProcurement Notices shall be inserted in at least\none newspaper of national circulation in the\nBorrower’s country (or in the official gazette, if\nany, or in an electronic portal with free access)\nin addition to UNDB online and dgMarket. The\nperiod allowed for submission of bids may be\nreduced to four weeks. Bidding and payment\nmay be limited to one currency widely used in\ninternational trade. \nProcurement of Commodities\n2.68\nMarket prices of commodities, such as\ngrain, animal feed, cooking oil, fuel, fertilizer,\nand metals, fluctuate, depending upon the\ndemand and supply at any particular time.\nMany are quoted in established commodity\nmarkets. Procurement often involves multiple\nawards for partial quantities to assure security\nof supply and multiple purchases over a period\nof time to take advantage of favorable market\nconditions and to keep inventories low. A list of\nprequalified bidders may be drawn up to\nwhom periodic invitations are issued. Bidders\nmay be invited to quote prices linked to the\nmarket price at the time of or prior to the\nshipments. Bid validities shall be as short as\npossible. A single currency in which the\ncommodity is usually priced in the market, may\nbe used for bidding and payment. The currency\nshall be specified in the bidding document.\nBidding documents may permit telexed or\nfaxed bids or bids submitted by electronic\nmeans, and in such cases either no bid security\nis required, or standing bid securities valid over\na specified period of time have been submitted\nby prequalified bidders. Standard contract\nconditions and forms consistent with market\npractices shall be used.\n36\n50 Procurement of smaller contracts is normally carried out\nin accordance with procedures followed by the private or\npublic entity handling the imports, or other established\ncommercial practices acceptable to the Bank, as described in\npara. 3.12.\nIII. OTHER METHODS OF\nPROCUREMENT\nGeneral\n3.1\nThis Section describes the methods of\nprocurement that can be used where ICB would\nnot be the most economic and efficient method\nof procurement, and where other methods are\ndeemed more appropriate.51 The Bank’s\npolicies with respect to margins of preference\nfor domestically manufactured goods and\nworks contracts do not apply to methods of\nprocurement other than ICB. Paragraphs 3.2 to\n3.7 describe the generally used methods in\ndescending order of preference and the\nremaining paragraphs the methods used in\nspecific circumstances.\nLimited International Bidding\n3.2\nLimited International Bidding (LIB) is\nessentially ICB by direct invitation without\nopen advertisement. It may be an appropriate\nmethod of procurement where (a) there is only\na limited number of suppliers, or (b) other\nexceptional reasons may justify departure from\nfull ICB procedures. Under LIB, Borrowers shall\nseek bids from a list of potential suppliers\nbroad enough to assure competitive prices,\nsuch list to include all suppliers when there are\nonly a limited number. Domestic preferences\nare not applicable in the evaluation of bids\nunder LIB. In all respects other than\nadvertisement and preferences, ICB procedures\nshall apply, including the publication of the\nAward of Contract as indicated in paragraph\n2.60.\nNational Competitive Bidding\n3.3\nNational Competitive Bidding (NCB) is\nthe competitive bidding procedure normally\nused for public procurement in the country of\n37\n51 Contracts shall not be divided into smaller units in order\nto make them less attractive for ICB procedures; any\nproposal to divide a contract into smaller packages shall\nrequire the prior approval of the Bank.\nthe Borrower, and may be the most appropriate\nway of procuring goods or works which, by\ntheir nature or scope, are unlikely to attract\nforeign competition. To be acceptable for use in\nBank-financed procurement, these procedures\nshall be reviewed and modified52 as necessary\nto assure economy, efficiency, transparency, and\nbroad consistency with the provisions included\nin Section I of these Guidelines. NCB may be\nthe most appropriate method of procurement\nwhere foreign bidders are not expected to be\ninterested because (a) the contract values are\nsmall, (b) works are scattered geographically or\nspread over time, (c) works are labor intensive,\nor (d) the goods or works are available locally\nat prices below the international market. NCB\nprocedures may also be used where the\nadvantages of ICB are clearly outweighed by\nthe administrative or financial burden involved.\n3.4\nAdvertising may be limited to the\nnational press or official gazette, or a free and\nopen access website. Bidding documents may\nbe only in a national language of the\nborrower’s country (or the language used\nnation-wide in the borrower’s country for\ncommercial transactions), and the currency of\nthe country of the Borrower is generally used\nfor the purposes of bidding and payment. In\naddition, the bidding documents shall provide\nclear instructions on how bids should be\nsubmitted, how prices should be offered, and\nthe place and time for submission of bids.\nAdequate response time for preparation and\nsubmission of bids shall be provided. The\nprocedures shall provide for adequate\ncompetition in order to ensure reasonable\nprices, and methods used in the evaluation of\nbids and the award of contracts shall be\nobjective and made known to all bidders in the\nbidding documents and not be applied\narbitrarily. The procedures shall also include\npublic opening of bids, publication of results of\nevaluation and of the award of contract and\n38\n52 Any such modification shall be reflected in the Loan\nAgreement.\nprovisions for bidders to protest. If foreign\nfirms wish to participate under these\ncircumstances, they shall be allowed to do so.\nShopping \n3.5\nShopping is a procurement method\nbased on comparing price quotations obtained\nfrom several suppliers (in the case of goods) or\nfrom several contractors (in the case of civil\nworks), with a minimum of three, to assure\ncompetitive prices, and is an appropriate\nmethod for procuring readily available off-the-\nshelf goods or standard specification\ncommodities of small value, or simple civil\nworks of small value. Requests for quotations\nshall indicate the description and quantity of\nthe goods or specifications of works, as well as\ndesired delivery (or completion) time and\nplace. Quotations may be submitted by letter,\nfacsimile or by electronic means. The evaluation\nof quotations shall follow the same principles\nas of open bidding. The terms of the accepted\noffer shall be incorporated in a purchase order\nor brief contract.\nDirect Contracting\n3.6\nDirect contracting is contracting\nwithout competition (single source) and may be\nan appropriate method under the following\ncircumstances:\n(a)\nAn existing contract for goods or\nworks, awarded in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to the Bank, may\nbe extended for additional goods or\nworks of a similar nature. The Bank\nshall be satisfied in such cases that no\nadvantage could be obtained by further\ncompetition and that the prices on the\nextended contract are reasonable.\nProvisions for such an extension, if\nconsidered likely in advance, shall be\nincluded in the original contract.\n(b)\nStandardization of equipment or spare\nparts, to be compatible with existing\nequipment, may justify additional\npurchases from the original Supplier.\n39\nFor such purchases to be justified, the\noriginal equipment shall be suitable,\nthe number of new items shall\ngenerally be less than the existing\nnumber, the price shall be reasonable,\nand the advantages of another make or\nsource of equipment shall have been\nconsidered and rejected on grounds\nacceptable to the Bank.\n(c)\nThe required equipment is proprietary\nand obtainable only from one source.\n(d)\nThe Contractor responsible for a\nprocess design requires the purchase of\ncritical items from a particular Supplier\nas a condition of a performance\nguarantee.\n(e)\nIn exceptional cases, such as in\nresponse to natural disasters.\n3.7\nAfter the contract signature, the\nBorrower shall publish in UNDB online and in\ndgMarket the name of the contractor, price,\nduration, and summary scope of the contract.\nThis publication may be done quarterly and in\nthe format of a summarized table covering the\nprevious period.\nForce Account\n3.8\nForce account, that is, construction by\nthe use of the Borrower’s own personnel and\nequipment,53 may be the only practical method\nfor constructing some kinds of works. The use\nof force account may be justified where:\n(a)\nquantities of work involved cannot be\ndefined in advance;\n(b)\nworks are small and scattered or in\nremote locations for which qualified\nconstruction firms are unlikely to bid at\nreasonable prices;\n40\n53 A government-owned construction unit that is not\nmanagerially and financially autonomous shall be\nconsidered a force account unit. “Force account” is\notherwise known as “direct labor,” “departmental forces,”\nor “direct work.”\n(c)\nwork is required to be carried out\nwithout disrupting ongoing operations;\n(d)\nrisks of unavoidable work interruption\nare better borne by the Borrower than\nby a Contractor; and\n(e)\nthere are emergencies needing prompt\nattention.\nProcurement from United Nations\nAgencies\n3.9\nThere may be situations in which\nprocurement directly from specialized agencies\nof the United Nations (UN), acting as suppliers,\npursuant to their own procedures, may be the\nmost appropriate way of procuring: (a) small\nquantities of off-the-shelf goods, primarily in\nthe fields of education and health; and (b)\nspecialized products where the number of\nsuppliers is limited such as for vaccines or\ndrugs.\nProcurement Agents\n3.10\nWhere Borrowers lack the necessary\norganization, resources, and experience,\nBorrowers may wish (or be required by the\nBank) to employ, as their agent, a firm\nspecializing in handling procurement. The\nagent shall follow all the procurement\nprocedures provided for in the Loan Agreement\nand as further elaborated in the Procurement\nPlan approved by the Bank on behalf of the\nBorrower, including use of Bank SBDs, review\nprocedures, and documentation. This also\napplies in cases where UN agencies act as\nprocurement agents.54 Management\nContractors may be employed in a similar\nmanner for a fee to contract for miscellaneous\nworks involving reconstruction, repairs,\nrehabilitation, and new construction in\n41\n54 The Consultant Guidelines shall apply for the selection of\nprocurement and inspection agents. The cost or fee of the\nprocurement or inspection agent is eligible for financing\nfrom the Bank loan, if so provided in the Loan Agreement\nand in the Procurement Plan , and provided the terms and\nconditions of selection and employment are acceptable to\nthe Bank.\nemergency situations, or where large numbers\nof small contracts are involved.\nInspection Agents\n3.11\nPreshipment inspection and\ncertification of imports is one of the safeguards\nfor the Borrower, particularly where the\ncountry has a large import program. The\ninspection and certification usually covers\nquality, quantity, and reasonableness of price.\nImports procured through ICB procedures shall\nnot be subject to price verification, but only\nverification for quality and quantity. However,\nimports not procured through ICB may\nadditionally be subjected to price verification.\nThe inspection agents are ordinarily paid for on\na fee basis levied on the value of the goods.\nCosts for certification of imports shall not be\nconsidered in the evaluation of bids under ICB.\nProcurement in Loans to Financial\nIntermediaries\n3.12\nWhere the loan provides funds to an\nintermediary institution such as an agricultural\ncredit institution or a development finance\ncompany, to be re-lent to beneficiaries such as\nindividuals, private sector enterprises, small\nand medium enterprises, or autonomous\ncommercial enterprises in the public sector for\nthe partial financing of subprojects, the\nprocurement is usually undertaken by the\nrespective beneficiaries in accordance with\nestablished private sector or commercial\npractices, which are acceptable to the Bank.\nHowever, even in these situations, ICB may be\nthe most appropriate procurement method for\nthe purchase of large single items or in cases\nwhere large quantities of like goods can be\ngrouped together for bulk purchasing.\n42\nProcurement under BOO/BOT/BOOT,\nConcessions and Similar Private Sector\nArrangements\n3.13\nWhere the Bank is participating in\nfinancing the cost of a project procured under a\nBOO/BOT/ BOOT,55 concessions or similar\ntype of private sector arrangement, either of the\nfollowing procurement procedures shall be\nused, as provided for in the Loan Agreement\nand further elaborated in the Procurement Plan\napproved by the Bank:\n(a)\nThe concessionaire or entrepreneur\nunder the BOO/BOT/ BOOT or similar\ntype of contract56 shall be selected\nunder ICB procedures acceptable to the\nBank, which may include several stages\nin order to arrive at the optimal\ncombination of evaluation criteria, such\nas the cost and magnitude of the\nfinancing offered, the performance\nspecifications of the facilities offered,\nthe cost charged to the user or\npurchaser, other income generated for\nthe Borrower or purchaser by the\nfacility, and the period of the facility’s\ndepreciation. The said entrepreneur\nselected in this manner shall then be\nfree to procure the goods, works, and\nservices required for the facility from\neligible sources, using its own\nprocedures. In this case, the Project\nAppraisal Document, and the Loan\nAgreement shall specify the type of\nexpenditures incurred by the said\nentrepreneur towards which Bank\nfinancing will apply.\nOr,\n(b)\nIf the said concessionaire or\nentrepreneur has not been selected in\nthe manner set forth in subparagraph\n43\n55 BOO: Build, Own, Operate; BOT: Build, Operate, Transfer;\nBOOT: Build, Own, Operate, Transfer.\n56 For projects such as toll roads, tunnels, harbors, bridges,\npower stations, waste disposal plants, and water\ndistribution systems.\n(a) above, the goods, works, or services\nrequired for the facility and to be\nfinanced by the Bank shall be procured\nin accordance with ICB procedures\ndefined in Section II.\nPerformance-Based Procurement\n3.14\nPerformance Based Procurement,57 also\ncalled Output-Based Procurement, refers to\ncompetitive procurement processes (ICB or\nNCB) resulting in a contractual relationship\nwhere payments are made for measured\noutputs instead of the traditional way where\ninputs are measured. The technical\nspecifications define the desired result and\nwhich outputs will be measured including how\nthey will be measured. Those outputs aim at\nsatisfying a functional need both in terms of\nquality, quantity and reliability. Payment is\nmade in accordance with the quantity of\noutputs delivered, subject to their delivery at\nthe level of quality required. Reductions from\npayments (or retentions) may be made for\nlower-quality level of outputs and, in certain\ncases, premiums may be paid for higher quality\nlevel of outputs. The bidding documents do not\nnormally prescribe the inputs, nor a work\nmethod for the contractor. The contractor is free\nto propose the most appropriate solution, based\non mature and well proven experience and\nshall demonstrate that the level of quality\nspecified in the bidding documents will be\nachieved. \n3.15\nPerformance Based Procurement (or\nOutput Based Procurement) can involve: (a) the\nprovision of services to be paid on the basis of\noutputs; (b) design, supply, construction (or\nrehabilitation) and commissioning of a facility\nto be operated by the borrower; or (c) design,\nsupply, construction (or rehabilitation) of a\n44\n57 The use of Performance Based Procurement in Bank\nfinanced projects should be the result of the satisfactory\ntechnical analysis of the different options available and\nshould be either included in the PAD or subject to prior\napproval by the Bank for incorporation into the\nprocurement plan.\nfacility and provision of services for its\noperation and maintenance for a defined period\nof years after its commissioning.58 For the cases\nwhere design, supply and/or construction are\nrequired, prequalification is normally required\nand the use of Two-Stage Bidding as indicated\nin paragraph 2.6 shall apply.\nProcurement under Loans Guaranteed by\nthe Bank\n3.16\nIf the Bank guarantees the repayment\nof a loan made by another lender, the goods\nand works financed by the said loan shall be\nprocured with due attention to economy and\nefficiency and in accordance with procedures\nwhich meet the requirements of paragraph 1.5.\nCommunity Participation in Procurement\n3.17\nWhere, in the interest of project\nsustainability, or to achieve certain specific\nsocial objectives of the project, it is desirable in\nselected project components to (a) call for the\nparticipation of local communities and/or\nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the\ndelivery of services, or (b) increase the\nutilization of local know-how and materials, or\n(c) employ labor-intensive and other\nappropriate technologies, the procurement\nprocedures, specifications, and contract\npackaging shall be suitably adapted to reflect\nthese considerations, provided these are efficient\nand are acceptable to the Bank. The procedures\nproposed and the project components to be\ncarried out by community participation shall be\noutlined in Loan Agreement and further\nelaborated in the Procurement Plan or the\nrelevant project implementation document\napproved by the Bank.\n45\n58 Examples of such type of procurement are: (i) for the case\nof procurement of services: provision of medical services,\ni.e. payments for specific services, like office visits, or\ndefined laboratory tests, etc. ; (ii) for the case of\nprocurement of a facility: Design, Procurement,\nConstruction, and Commissioning of a thermal power plant\nto be operated by the borrower; (iii) for the case of\nprocurement of a facility and services: Design, Procurement,\nConstruction (or Rehabilitation) of a road and operation and\nmaintenance of the road for 5 years after construction.\nAPPENDIX 1: REVIEW BY THE BANK\nOF PROCUREMENT DECISIONS\nScheduling of Procurement\n1.\nThe Bank shall review the procurement\narrangements proposed by the Borrower in the\nProcurement Plan for its conformity with the\nLoan Agreement and these Guidelines. The\nProcurement Plan shall cover an initial period\nof at least 18 months. The Borrower shall\nupdate the Procurement Plan on an annual\nbasis or as needed always covering the next 18\nmonths period of project implementation. Any\nrevisions proposed to the Procurement Plan\nshall be furnished to the Bank for its prior\napproval. \nPrior Review\n2.\nWith respect to all contracts59 which are\nsubject to the Bank’s prior review:\n(a)\nIn cases where prequalification is used,\nthe Borrower shall, before\nprequalification submissions are\ninvited, furnish the Bank with the draft\ndocuments to be used, including the\ntext of the invitation to prequalify, the\nprequalification questionnaire, and the\nevaluation methodology, together with\na description of the advertising\nprocedures to be followed, and shall\nintroduce such modifications in said\nprocedure and documents, as the Bank\nshall reasonably request. The report\nevaluating the applications received by\nthe Borrower, the list of proposed\nprequalified bidders, together with a\nstatement of their qualifications and of\nthe reasons for the exclusion of any\napplicant for prequalification, shall be\n46\n59 For contracts procured on the basis of direct contracting\nunder paras. 3.6 and 3.7, the Borrower shall furnish to the\nBank for its approval, prior to contract execution, a copy of\nthe specifications and the draft contract. The contract shall\nbe executed only after the Bank has given its approval, and\nthe provisions in (h) of this paragraph shall apply with\nrespect to the executed contract.\nfurnished by the Borrower to the Bank\nfor its comments before the applicants\nare notified of the Borrower’s decision,\nand the Borrower shall make such\nadditions to, deletions from, or\nmodifications in the said list as the\nBank shall reasonably request.\n(b)\nBefore bids are invited, the Borrower\nshall furnish to the Bank for its\ncomments, draft bidding documents,\nincluding the invitation to bid;\ninstructions to bidders, including the\nbasis of bid evaluation and contract\naward; and the conditions of contract\nand specifications for the civil works,\nsupply of goods, or installation of\nequipment, etc., as the case may be,\ntogether with a description of the\nadvertising procedures to be followed\nfor the bidding (if prequalification has\nnot been used), and shall make such\nmodifications in the said documents as\nthe Bank shall reasonably request. Any\nfurther modification shall require the\nBank’s approval before it is issued to\nthe prospective bidders.\n(c)\nAfter bids have been received and\nevaluated, the Borrower shall, before a\nfinal decision on the award is made,\nfurnish to the Bank, in sufficient time\nfor its review, a detailed report\n(prepared, if the Bank shall so request,\nby experts acceptable to the Bank), on\nthe evaluation and comparison of the\nbids received, together with the\nrecommendations for award and such\nother information as the Bank shall\nreasonably request. The Bank shall, if it\ndetermines that the intended award\nwould be inconsistent with the Loan\nAgreement and/or the Procurement\nPlan, promptly inform the Borrower\nand state the reasons for such\ndetermination. Otherwise, the Bank\nshall provide its no objection to the\nrecommendation for contract award.\n47\nThe Borrower shall award the contract\nonly after receiving the “no objection”\nfrom the Bank.\n(d)\nIf the Borrower requires an extension of\nbid validity to complete the process of\nevaluation, obtain necessary approvals\nand clearances, and to make the award,\nit should seek the Bank’s prior\napproval for the first request for\nextension, if it is longer than four\nweeks, and for all subsequent requests\nfor extension, irrespective of the period. \n(e)\nIf after publication of the results of\nevaluation, the Borrower receives\nprotests or complaints from bidders, a\ncopy of the complaint and a copy of the\nBorrower’s response shall be sent to the\nBank for information.\n(f)\nIf as result of analysis of a protest the\nborrower changes its contract award\nrecommendation, the reasons for such\ndecision and a revised evaluation\nreport shall be submitted to the Bank\nfor no objection. The Borrower shall\nprovide a republication of the contract\naward in the format of paragraph 2.60\nof these Guidelines.\n(g)\nThe terms and conditions of a contract\nshall not, without the Bank’s prior\napproval, materially differ from those\non which bids were asked or\nprequalification of Contractors, if any,\nwas invited.\n(h)\nOne conformed copy of the contract\nshall be furnished to the Bank promptly\nafter its execution and prior to delivery\nto the Bank of the first application for\nwithdrawal of funds from the Loan\nAccount in respect of such contract.\nWhere payments for the contract are to\nbe made out of a Special Account (SA),\na copy of the contract shall be\nfurnished to the Bank prior to the\n48\nmaking of the first payment out of the\nSA in respect of such contract.\n(i)\nAll evaluation reports shall be\naccompanied by a summary of the\nprocurement on a form provided by the\nBank. The description and amount of\nthe contract, together with the name\nand address of the successful bidder,\nshall be subject to release by the Bank\nupon receipt of the signed copy of the\ncontract.\n3.\nModifications. In the case of contracts\nsubject to prior review, before granting a\nmaterial extension of the stipulated time for\nperformance of a contract, agreeing to any\nmodification or waiver of the conditions of\nsuch contract, including issuing any change\norder or orders under such contract (except in\ncases of extreme urgency) which would in\naggregate increase the original amount of the\ncontract by more than 15 percent of the original\nprice, the Borrower shall seek the Bank’s no\nobjection to the proposed extension,\nmodification, or change order. If the Bank\ndetermines that the proposal would be\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Loan\nAgreement and/or Procurement Plan, it shall\npromptly inform the Borrower and state the\nreasons for its determination. A copy of all\namendments to the contract shall be furnished\nto the Bank for its record.\n4.\nTranslations. If a contract awarded\nunder ICB procedures is subject to prior-review\nand is written in the national language,60 (or\nthe language used nation-wide in the\nborrower’s country for commercial\ntransactions) a certified translation of the\ncontract in the internationally used language\nspecified in the bidding documents (English,\nFrench, or Spanish) shall be furnished to the\nBank together with the conformed copy of the\ncontract. Such certified translations shall also be\nfurnished to the Bank, for any subsequent\nmodifications of such contracts.\n49\n60 Refer to para. 2.15.\nPost Review\n5.\nThe Borrower shall retain all\ndocumentation with respect to each contract\nnot governed by paragraph two during Project\nimplementation and up to two years after the\nclosing date of the Loan Agreement. This\ndocumentation would include, but not be\nlimited to, the signed original of the contract,\nthe analysis of the respective proposals, and\nrecommendations for award, for examination\nby the Bank or by its consultants. The Borrower\nshall also furnish such documentation to the\nBank upon request. If the Bank determines that\nthe goods, works or services were not procured\nin accordance with the agreed procedures, as\nreflected in the Loan Agreement and further\ndetailed in the Procurement Plan approved by\nthe Bank or that the contract itself is not\nconsistent with such procedures, it may declare\nmisprocurement as established in paragraph\n1.12 of the Guidelines. The Bank shall promptly\ninform the Borrower the reasons for such\ndetermination.\n50\nAPPENDIX 2: DOMESTIC\nPREFERENCES\nPreference for Domestically Manufactured\nGoods\n1.\nThe Borrower may, with the agreement\nof the Bank, grant a margin of preference in the\nevaluation of bids under ICB procedures to bids\noffering certain goods manufactured in the\ncountry of the Borrower, when compared to\nbids offering such goods manufactured\nelsewhere. In such cases, bidding documents\nshall clearly indicate any preference to be\ngranted to domestic manufactured goods and\nthe information required to establish the\neligibility of a bid for such preference. The\nnationality of the manufacturer or Supplier is\nnot a condition for such eligibility. The methods\nand stages set forth hereunder shall be followed\nin the evaluation and comparison of bids.\n2.\nFor comparison, responsive bids shall\nbe classified in one of the following three\ngroups:\n(a)\nGroup A: bids exclusively offering\ngoods manufactured in the country of\nthe Borrower if the bidder establishes\nto the satisfaction of the Borrower and\nthe Bank that (i) labor, raw material,\nand components from within the\ncountry of the Borrower will account\nfor 30 percent or more of the EXW price\nof the product offered, and (ii) the\nproduction facility in which those\ngoods will be manufactured or\nassembled has been engaged in\nmanufacturing/assembling such goods\nat least since the time of bid\nsubmission.\n(b)\nGroup B: all other bids offering goods\nmanufactured in the country of the\nBorrower.\n(c)\nGroup C: bids offering goods\nmanufactured abroad that have been\n51\nalready imported or that will be\ndirectly imported.\n3.\nThe price quoted for goods in bids of\nGroups A and B shall include all duties and\ntaxes paid or payable on the basic materials or\ncomponents purchased in the domestic market\nor imported, but shall exclude the sales and\nsimilar taxes on the finished product. The price\nquoted for goods in bids of Group C shall be on\nCIP (place of destination), which is exclusive of\ncustoms duties and other import taxes already\npaid or to be paid.\n4.\nIn the first step, all evaluated bids in\neach group shall be compared to determine the\nlowest bid in each group. Such lowest\nevaluated bids shall be compared with each\nother and if, as a result of this comparison, a\nbid from Group A or Group B is the lowest, it\nshall be selected for the award. \n5.\nIf as a result of the comparison under\nparagraph four above, the lowest evaluated bid\nis a bid from Group C, the lowest evaluated bid\nfrom Group C shall be further compared with\nthe lowest evaluated bid from Group A after\nadding to the evaluated price of goods offered\nin the bid from Group C, for the purpose of this\nfurther comparison only, an amount equal to 15\npercent of the CIP bid price. The lowest\nevaluated bid determined from this last\ncomparison shall be selected.\n6.\nIn the case of single responsibility or\nturnkey contracts for the supply of a number of\ndiscrete items of equipment as well as major\ninstallation and/or construction services no\nmargin of preference shall apply.61 However,\nwith Bank’s “no objection”, bids for such\n52\n61 This does not refer to the supply of goods with\nsupervision of installation in the same contract which is\nconsidered a contract for the supply of goods, and therefore\neligible for the application of domestic preference in the\ngoods component.\ncontracts may be invited and evaluated on the\nbasis of DDP62 (named place of destination)\nprices for goods manufactured abroad.\nPreference for Domestic Contractors\n7.\nFor contracts for works to be awarded\non the basis of ICB, eligible Borrowers may,\nwith the agreement of the Bank, grant a margin\nof preference of 7.5 percent to domestic\ncontractors,63 in accordance with, and subject\nto, the following provisions:\n(a)\nContractors applying for such\npreference shall be asked to provide, as\npart of the data for qualification,64 such\ninformation, including details of\nownership, as shall be required to\ndetermine whether, according to the\nclassification established by the\nBorrower and accepted by the Bank, a\nparticular contractor or group of\ncontractors qualifies for a domestic\npreference. The bidding documents\nshall clearly indicate the preference and\nthe method that will be followed in the\nevaluation and comparison of bids to\ngive effect to such preference.\n53\n62 DDP is the INCOTERM which stands for “Delivered Duty\nPaid” where the seller delivers the goods to the buyer,\ncleared for import, and not unloaded from any arriving\nmeans of transport at the named place of destination. The\nseller has to bear all the costs and risks involved in bringing\nthe goods thereto including, where applicable, any duty for\nimport in the country of destination, and unloading at final\ndestination as part of the turn-key contract. In countries that\nexempt bidders on imports under contracts financed by the\nBank, comparison shall be made on the basis of non-\nexemption of duties and taxes on importation of goods\nmanufactured abroad and the bidding documents may\nindicate that, before contract signature, the purchaser and\nthe winning bidder will identify the amount of taxes\npayable for importation of the goods offered resulting from\nthat exemption. However, the contract amount to be signed\nwill not include the identified total amount of exempted\nduties and taxes\n63 Preference for domestic Contractors is applicable only in\ncountries which qualify. \n64 At the prequalification and/or at the bidding stage.\n(b)\nAfter bids have been received and\nreviewed by the Borrower, responsive\nbids shall be classified into the\nfollowing groups:\n(i)\nGroup A: bids offered by\ndomestic contractors eligible\nfor the preference.\n(ii)\nGroup B: bids offered by other\ncontractors.\nFor the purpose of evaluation and comparison\nof bids, an amount equal to 7.5 percent of the\nbid amount shall be added to bids received\nfrom Contractors in Group B.\n54\nAPPENDIX 3: GUIDANCE TO\nBIDDERS\nPurpose\n1.\nThis Appendix provides guidance to\npotential bidders wishing to participate in\nBank-financed procurement.\nResponsibility for Procurement\n2.\nThe responsibility for the\nimplementation of the project, and therefore for\nthe payment of goods, works, and services\nunder the project, rests solely with the\nBorrower. The Bank, for its part, is required by\nits Articles of Agreement to ensure that funds\nare paid from a Bank loan only as expenditures\nare incurred. Disbursements of the proceeds of\na loan are made only at the Borrower’s request.\nSupporting evidence that the funds are used in\naccordance with the Loan Agreement and/or\nthe Procurement Plan shall be submitted with\nthe Borrower’s withdrawal application.\nPayment may be made (a) to reimburse the\nBorrower for payment(s) already made from its\nown resources, (b) directly to a third party\n(usually to a supplier or contractor), or (c) to a\ncommercial bank for expenditures against a\nWorld Bank Special Commitment covering a\ncommercial bank’s letter of credit.65 As\nemphasized in paragraph 1.2 of the Guidelines,\nthe Borrower is legally responsible for the\nprocurement. It invites, receives, and evaluates\nbids, and awards the contract. The contract is\nbetween the Borrower and the supplier or\ncontractor. The Bank is not a party to the\ncontract.\nBank’s Role\n3.\nAs stated in paragraph 1.11 of the\nGuidelines, the Bank reviews the procurement\nprocedures, documents, bid evaluations, award\nrecommendations, and the contract to ensure\n55\n65 A complete description of the Bank’s disbursement\nprocedures is provided in the Disbursement Handbook\n(available on the Bank’s website at\nhttp://www.worldbank.org/projects. \nthat the process is carried out in accordance\nwith agreed procedures, as required in the Loan\nAgreement. In the case of major contracts, the\ndocuments are reviewed by the Bank prior to\ntheir issue, as described in Appendix 1. Also, if,\nat any time in the procurement process (even\nafter the award of contract), the Bank concludes\nthat the agreed procedures were not followed\nin any material respect, the Bank may declare\nmisprocurement, as described in paragraph\n1.12. However, if a Borrower has awarded a\ncontract after obtaining the Bank’s “no\nobjection,” the Bank will declare\nmisprocurement only if the “no objection” was\nissued on the basis of incomplete, inaccurate, or\nmisleading information furnished by the\nBorrower. Furthermore, if the Bank determines\nthat corrupt or fraudulent practices were\nengaged in by representatives of the Borrower\nor of the bidder, the Bank may impose the\napplicable sanctions set forth in paragraph 1.14\nof the Guidelines.\n4.\nThe Bank has published Standard\nBidding Documents (SBDs) for various types of\nprocurement. As stated in paragraph 2.12 of the\nGuidelines, it is mandatory for the Borrower to\nuse these documents, with minimum changes\nto address country- and project-specific issues.\nThe prequalification and bidding documents\nare finalized and issued by the Borrower.\nInformation on Bidding\n5.\nInformation on bidding opportunities\nunder ICB may be obtained from the General\nProcurement Notice and the Specific\nProcurement Notices as described in\nparagraphs 2.7 and 2.8 of the Guidelines.\nGeneral guidance on participation, as well as\nadvance information on business opportunities\nin upcoming projects, may be obtained from the\nWorld Bank website66 as well as from the\nInfoshop.67 Project Appraisal Documents (PAD)\n56\n66 http://www.worldbank.org.\n67 The Infoshop address is the World Bank address at 1818\nH Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20433, U.S.A. The Project\nDatabase is available at:\nhttp://www.worldbank.org/projects/.\nare also available from the Infoshop and on the\nBank’s website upon approval of the loan.\nBidder’s Role\n6.\nOnce a bidder receives the\nprequalification or bidding document, the\nbidder should study the documents carefully to\ndecide if it can meet the technical, commercial,\nand contractual conditions, and if so, proceed\nto prepare its bid. The bidder should then\ncritically review the documents to see if there is\nany ambiguity, omission, or internal\ncontradiction, or any feature of specifications or\nother conditions which are unclear or appear\ndiscriminatory or restrictive; if so, it should\nseek clarification from the Borrower, in writing,\nwithin the time period specified in the bidding\ndocuments for seeking clarifications.\n7.\nThe criteria and methodology for\nselection of the successful bidder are outlined\nin the bidding documents, generally under\nInstructions to Bidders and Specifications. If\nthese are not clear, clarification should be\nsimilarly sought from the Borrower.\n8.\nIn this connection it should be\nemphasized that the specific bidding\ndocuments issued by the Borrower govern each\nprocurement, as stated in paragraph 1.1 of the\nGuidelines. If a bidder feels that any of the\nprovisions in the documents are inconsistent\nwith the Guidelines, it should also raise this\nwith the Borrower.\n9.\nIt is the responsibility of the bidder to\nraise any issue of ambiguity, contradiction,\nomission, etc., prior to the submission of its bid,\nto assure submission of a fully responsive and\ncompliant bid, including all the supporting\ndocuments requested in the bidding\ndocuments. Noncompliance with critical\n(technical and commercial) requirements will\nresult in rejection of the bid. If a bidder wishes\nto propose deviations to a noncritical\nrequirement, or propose an alternative solution,\nthe bidder should quote the price for the fully\ncompliant bid and then separately indicate the\n57\nadjustment in price that can be offered if the\ndeviation is accepted. Alternative solutions\nshould be offered only when authorized in the\nbidding documents. Once bids are received and\npublicly opened, bidders will not be required or\npermitted to change the price or substance of a\nbid.\nConfidentiality\n10.\nAs stated in paragraph 2.47 of the\nGuidelines, the process of bid evaluation shall\nbe confidential until the publication of contract\naward . This is essential to enable the Borrower\nand Bank reviewers to avoid either the reality\nor perception of improper interference. If at this\nstage a bidder wishes to bring additional\ninformation to the notice of the Borrower, the\nBank, or both, it should do so in writing.\nAction by the Bank\n11.\nBidders are free to send copies of their\ncommunications on issues and questions with\nthe Borrower to the Bank or to write to the\nBank directly, when Borrowers do not respond\npromptly, or the communication is a complaint\nagainst the Borrower. All such communications\nshould be addressed to the Task Team Leader\nfor the project, with a copy to the Country\nDirector for the borrowing country and to the\nRegional Procurement Adviser. Names of Task\nTeam Leaders are available in the PAD.\n12.\nReferences received by the Bank from\npotential bidders, prior to the closing date for\nsubmission of the bids, will, if appropriate, be\nreferred to the Borrower with the Bank’s\ncomments and advice, for action or response.\n13.\nCommunication received from bidders\nafter the opening of the bids, will be handled as\nfollows. In the case of contracts not subject to\nprior review by the Bank, the communication\nwill be sent to the Borrower for due\nconsideration and appropriate action, if any,\nand these will be reviewed during subsequent\nsupervision of the project by Bank staff. In the\ncases of contracts subject to the prior review\nprocess, the communication will be examined\n58\nby the Bank, in consultation with the Borrower.\nIf additional data is required to complete this\nprocess, these will be obtained from the\nBorrower. If additional information or\nclarification is required from the bidder, the\nBank will ask the Borrower to obtain it and\ncomment or incorporate it, as appropriate, in\nthe evaluation report. The Bank’s review will\nnot be completed until the communication is\nfully examined and considered.\n14.\nExcept for acknowledgment, the Bank\nwill not enter into discussion or correspondence\nwith any bidder during the evaluation and\nreview process of the procurement, until award\nof the contract is published.\nDebriefing\n15.\nAs stated in paragraph 2.65, if, after\nnotification of award, a bidder wishes to\nascertain the grounds on which its bid was not\nselected, it should address its request to the\nBorrower. If the bidder is not satisfied with the\nexplanation given and wishes to seek a meeting\nwith the Bank, it may do so by addressing the\nRegional Procurement Adviser for the\nborrowing country, who will arrange a meeting\nat the appropriate level and with the relevant\nstaff. In this discussion, only the bidder’s bid\ncan be discussed and not the bids of\ncompetitors.\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n",

un united nations undb united nations development business vi i. introduction purpose 1.1 the purpose of these guidelines is to inform those carrying out a project that is financed in whole or in part by a loan from the international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd) or a credit or grant from the international development association (ida),1 of the policies that govern the procurement of goods, works, and services (other than consultant services) 2 required for the project. the loan agreement governs the legal relationships between the borrower and the bank, and the guidelines are made applicable to procurement of goods and works for the project, as provided in the agreement. the rights and obligations of the borrower and the providers of goods and works for the project are governed by the bidding3 documents, and by the contracts signed by the borrower with the providers of goods and works, and not by these guidelines or the loan agreements. no party other than the parties to the loan agreement shall derive any rights therefrom or have any claim to loan proceeds. 1 1 procurement requirements of ibrd and ida are identical, and references in these guidelines to the bank include both ibrd and ida, and references to loans include ibrd loans as well as ida credits or grants and project preparation advances (ppas). references to loan agreement includes development credit agreement, development financing agreement, development grant agreement, and project agreement. references to “borrower” include the recipient of an ida grant. 2 references to “goods” and “works” in these guidelines include related services such as transportation, insurance, installation, commissioning, training, and initial maintenance. “goods” includes commodities, raw material, machinery, equipment, and industrial plant. the provisions of these guidelines also apply to services which are bid and contracted on the basis of performance of a measurable physical output, such as drilling, mapping, and similar operations. these guidelines do not refer to consultants’ services, to which the current guidelines: selection and employment of consultants by world bank borrowers apply (referred to herein as consultant guidelines). 3 for the purposes of these guidelines, the words “bid” and “tender” shall have the same meaning. general considerations 1.2 the responsibility for the implementation of the project, and therefore for the award and administration of contracts under the project, rests with the borrower.4 the bank, for its part, is required by its articles of agreement to “…ensure that the proceeds of any loan are used only for the purposes for which the loan was granted, with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency and without regard to political or other non- economic influences or considerations,”5 and it has established detailed procedures for this purpose. while in practice the specific procurement rules and procedures to be followed in the implementation of a project depend on the circumstances of the particular case, four considerations generally guide the bank’s requirements: (a) the need for economy and efficiency in the implementation of the project, including the procurement of the goods and works involved; (b) the bank’s interest in giving all eligible bidders from developed and developing countries6 the same information and equal opportunity to compete in providing goods and works financed by the bank; (c) the bank’s interest in encouraging the development of domestic contracting and manufacturing industries in the borrowing country; and (d) the importance of transparency in the procurement process. 2 4 in some cases, the borrower acts only as an intermediary, and the project is carried out by another agency or entity. references in these guidelines to the borrower include such agencies and entities, as well as sub-borrowers under on- lending arrangements. 5 the bank’s articles of agreement; article iii, section 5(b) and ida’s articles of agreement; article v, section 1(g). 6 see para. 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8. 1.3 open competition is the basis for efficient public procurement. borrowers shall select the most appropriate method for the specific procurement. in most cases, international competitive bidding (icb), properly administered, and with the allowance for preferences for domestically manufactured goods and, where appropriate, for domestic contractors7 for works under prescribed conditions is the most appropriate method. in most cases, therefore, the bank requires its borrowers to obtain goods, works and services through icb open to eligible suppliers and contractors.8 section ii of these guidelines describes the procedures for icb. 1.4 where icb is not the most appropriate method of procurement, other methods of procurement may be used. section iii describes these other methods of procurement and the circumstances under which their application would be more appropriate. the particular methods that may be followed for procurement under a given project are provided for in the loan agreement. the specific contracts to be financed under the project, and their method of procurement, consistent with the loan agreement, are specified in the procurement plan as indicated in paragraph 1.16 of these guidelines. applicability of guidelines 1.5 the procedures outlined in these guidelines apply to all contracts for goods and works financed in whole or in part from bank loans.9 for the procurement of those contracts for goods and works not financed from a bank loan, the borrower may adopt other procedures. in such cases the bank shall be satisfied that the procedures to be used will fulfill the borrower’s obligations to cause the project to be carried out diligently and 3 7 for purposes of these guidelines, “contractor” refers only to a firm providing construction services. 8 see para. 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8. 9 this includes those cases where the borrower employs a procurement agent under para. 3.10. efficiently, and that the goods and works to be procured: (a) are of satisfactory quality and are compatible with the balance of the project; (b) will be delivered or completed in timely fashion; and (c) are priced so as not to affect adversely the economic and financial viability of the project. eligibility 1.6 to foster competition the bank permits firms and individuals from all countries to offer goods, works, and services for bank-financed projects. any conditions for participation shall be limited to those that are essential to ensure the firm’s capability to fulfill the contract in question.10 1.7 in connection with any contract to be financed in whole or in part from a bank loan, the bank does not permit a borrower to deny pre- or post-qualification to a firm for reasons unrelated to its capability and resources to successfully perform the contract; nor does it permit a borrower to disqualify any bidder for such reasons. consequently, borrowers should carry out due diligence on the technical and financial qualifications of bidders to be assured of their capabilities in relation to the specific contract. 1.8 as exceptions to the foregoing: (a) firms of a country or goods manufactured in a country may be excluded if, (i) as a matter of law or official regulation, the borrower’s country prohibits commercial relations with that country, provided that the 4 10 the bank permits firms and individuals from taiwan, china, to offer goods, works, and services for bank-financed projects. bank is satisfied that such exclusion does not preclude effective competition for the supply of goods or works required, or (ii) by an act of compliance with a decision of the united nations security council taken under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations, the borrower’s country prohibits any import of goods from, or payments to, a particular country, person, or entity. where the borrower's country prohibits payments to a particular firm or for particular goods by such an act of compliance, that firm may be excluded. (b) a firm which has been engaged by the borrower to provide consulting services for the preparation or implementation of a project, and any of its affiliates, shall be disqualified from subsequently providing goods, works, or services resulting from or directly related to the firm’s consulting services for such preparation or implementation. this provision does not apply to the various firms (consultants, contractors, or suppliers) which together are performing the contractor’s obligations under a turnkey or design and build contract.11 (c) government-owned enterprises in the borrower’s country may participate only if they can establish that they (i) are legally and financially autonomous, (ii) operate under commercial law, and (iii) are not dependent agencies of the borrower or sub-borrower.12 (d) a firm declared ineligible by the bank in accordance with subparagraph (d) of paragraph 1.14 of these guidelines shall be ineligible to be awarded a 5 11 see para. 2.5. 12 other than force account units, as permitted under para. 3.8. bank-financed contract during the period of time determined by the bank. advance contracting and retroactive financing 1.9 the borrower may wish to proceed with the initial steps of procurement before signing the related bank loan. in such cases, the procurement procedures, including advertising, shall be in accordance with the guidelines in order for the eventual contracts to be eligible for bank financing, and the bank shall review the process used by the borrower. a borrower undertakes such advance contracting at its own risk, and any concurrence by the bank with the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award does not commit the bank to make a loan for the project in question. if the contract is signed, reimbursement by the bank of any payments made by the borrower under the contract prior to loan signing is referred to as retroactive financing and is only permitted within the limits specified in the loan agreement. joint ventures 1.10 any firm may bid independently or in joint venture confirming joint and several liability, either with domestic firms and/or with foreign firms, but the bank does not accept conditions of bidding which require mandatory joint ventures or other forms of mandatory association between firms. bank review 1.11 the bank reviews the borrower’s procurement procedures, documents, bid evaluations, award recommendations, and contracts to ensure that the procurement process is carried out in accordance with the agreed procedures. these review procedures are described in appendix 1. the procurement plan approved by the bank13 shall specify the extent to which these review procedures shall 6 13 see paragraphs 1.16. apply in respect of the different categories of goods and works to be financed, in whole or in part, from the bank loan. misprocurement 1.12 the bank does not finance expenditures for goods and works which have not been procured in accordance with the agreed provisions in the loan agreement and as further elaborated in the procurement plan.14 in such cases, the bank will declare misprocurement, and it is the policy of the bank to cancel that portion of the loan allocated to the goods and works that have been misprocured. the bank may, in addition, exercise other remedies provided for under the loan agreement. even once the contract is awarded after obtaining a “no objection” from the bank, the bank may still declare misprocurement if it concludes that the “no objection” was issued on the basis of incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information furnished by the borrower or the terms and conditions of the contract had been modified without bank’s approval. references to bank 1.13 if the borrower wishes to refer to the bank in procurement documents, the following language shall be used: “(name of borrower) has received (or in appropriate cases ‘has applied for’) a [loan] from the [international bank for reconstruction and development] (the “bank”) in an amount equivalent to usd toward the cost of (name of project), and intends to apply a portion of the proceeds of this [loan] to eligible payments under this contract. payment by the bank will be made only at the request of (name of borrower or designate) and upon approval by the bank, and will be subject, in all respects, to the terms and conditions of the [loan] agreement. the [loan] agreement prohibits a 7 14 see paragraph 1.16. withdrawal from the [loan] account for the purpose of any payment to persons or entities, or for any import of goods, if such payment or import, to the knowledge of the bank, is prohibited by a decision of the united nations security council taken under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations.15 no party other than (name of borrower) shall derive any rights from the loan agreement or have any claim to the proceeds of the [loan].”16 fraud and corruption 1.14 it is the bank’s policy to require that borrowers (including beneficiaries of bank loans), as well as bidders, suppliers, and contractors under bank-financed contracts, observe the highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of such contracts. in pursuance of this policy, the bank: (a) defines, for the purposes of this provision, the terms set forth below as follows: (i) “corrupt practice” means the offering, giving, receiving, or soliciting, directly or indirectly, of any thing of value to influence the action of a public official17 in the procurement process or in contract execution; (ii) “fraudulent practice” means a misrepresentation or omission of facts in order to influence a procurement process or the execution of a contract; (iii) “collusive practices” means a scheme or arrangement 8 15 ibrd’s general conditions applicable to loans and guarantee agreements; article v; section 5.01 and ida’s general conditions applicable to development credit agreements; article v; section 5.01 16 substitute “credit,” “international development association,” and “credit agreement,” as appropriate. 17 includes world bank staff and employees of other organizations taking or reviewing procurement decisions. between two or more bidders, with or without the knowledge of the borrower, designed to establish bid prices at artificial, non-competitive levels; (iv) “coercive practices” means harming or threatening to harm, directly or indirectly, persons, or their property to influence their participation in a procurement process, or affect the execution of a contract. (b) will reject a proposal for award if it determines that the bidder recommended for award has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in competing for the contract in question; (c) will cancel the portion of the loan allocated to a contract if it determines at any time that representatives of the borrower or of a beneficiary of the loan engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices during the procurement or the execution of that contract, without the borrower having taken timely and appropriate action satisfactory to the bank to remedy the situation; (d) will sanction a firm or individual, including declaring ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, to be awarded a bank-financed contract if it at any time determines that the firm has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices in competing for, or in executing, a bank- financed contract; and (e) will have the right to require that a provision be included in bidding documents and in contracts financed by a bank loan, a provision be included 9 requiring bidders, suppliers and contractors to permit the bank to inspect their accounts and records and other documents relating to the bid submission and contract performance and to have them audited by auditors appointed by the bank. 1.15 with the specific agreement of the bank, a borrower may introduce, into bid forms for large contracts financed by the bank, an undertaking of the bidder to observe, in competing for and executing a contract, the country’s laws against fraud and corruption (including bribery), as listed in the bidding documents.18 the bank will accept the introduction of such undertaking at the request of the borrowing country, provided the arrangements governing such undertaking are satisfactory to the bank. procurement plan 1.16 as part of the preparation of the project the borrower shall prepare and, before loan negotiations, furnish to the bank for its approval, a procurement plan19 acceptable to the bank setting forth: (a) the particular contracts for the goods, works, and/or services required to carry out the project during the initial period of at least 18 months; (b) the proposed methods for procurement of such contracts that are permitted under the loan agreement, and (c) the related bank review procedures.20 the borrower shall update the 10 18 as an example, such an undertaking might read as follows: “we undertake that, in competing for (and, if the award is made to us, in executing) the above contract, we will strictly observe the laws against fraud and corruption in force in the country of the [purchaser] [employer], as such laws have been listed by the [purchaser] [employer] in the bidding documents for this contract.” 19 if the project includes the selection of consulting services, the procurement plan should also include the methods for selection of consulting services in accordance with the guidelines: selection and employment of consultants by world bank borrowers. the bank will disclose the initial procurement plan to the public after the related loan has been approved; additional updates will be disclosed after the bank has approved them. 20 see appendix 1 procurement plan annually or as needed throughout the duration of the project. the borrower shall implement the procurement plan in the manner in which it has been approved by the bank. ii. international competitive bidding a. general introduction 2.1 the objective of international competitive bidding (icb), as described in these guidelines, is to provide all eligible prospective bidders21 with timely and adequate notification of a borrower’s requirements and an equal opportunity to bid for the required goods and works. type and size of contracts 2.2 the bidding documents shall clearly state the type of contract to be entered into and contain the proposed contract provisions appropriate therefor. the most common types of contracts provide for payments on the basis of a lump sum, unit prices, reimbursable cost plus fees, or combinations thereof. reimbursable cost contracts are acceptable to the bank only in exceptional circumstances such as conditions of high risk or where costs cannot be determined in advance with sufficient accuracy. such contracts shall include appropriate incentives to limit costs. 2.3 the size and scope of individual contracts will depend on the magnitude, nature, and location of the project. for projects requiring a variety of goods and works, separate contracts generally are awarded for the supply and/or installation of different items of equipment and plant22 and for the works. 11 21 see para. 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8. 22 for purposes of these guidelines, “plant” refers to installed equipment, as in a production facility. 2.4 for a project requiring similar but separate items of equipment or works, bids may be invited under alternative contract options that would attract the interest of both small and large firms, which could be allowed, at their option, to bid for individual contracts (slices) or for a group of similar contracts (package). all bids and combinations of bids shall be received by the same deadline and opened and evaluated simultaneously so as to determine the bid or combination of bids offering the lowest evaluated cost to the borrower.23 2.5 in certain cases the bank may accept or require a turnkey contract under which the design and engineering, the supply and installation of equipment, and the construction of a complete facility or works are provided under one contract. alternatively, the borrower may remain responsible for the design and engineering, and invite bids for a single responsibility contract for the supply and installation of all goods and works required for the project component. design and build, and management contracting24 contracts are also acceptable where appropriate.25 two-stage bidding 2.6 in the case of turnkey contracts or contracts for large complex facilities or works of a special nature or complex information and communication technology, it may be undesirable or impractical to prepare complete technical specifications in advance. in such a case, a two-stage bidding procedure may be used, under which first unpriced technical 12 23 see paras. 2.49-2.54 for the bid evaluation procedures. 24 in construction, a management contractor usually does not perform the work directly but contracts out and manages the work of other contractors, taking on the full responsibility and risk for price, quality, and timely performance. conversely, a construction manager is a consultant for, or agent of, the borrower, but does not take on such risks. (if financed by the bank, the services of the construction manager should be procured under the consultant guidelines. see footnote 2.) 25 also see paras. 3.14 and 3.15 for performance-based contracting. proposals on the basis of a conceptual design or performance specifications are invited, subject to technical as well as commercial clarifications and adjustments, to be followed by amended bidding documents26 and the submission of final technical proposals and priced bids in the second stage. notification and advertising 2.7 timely notification of bidding opportunities is essential in competitive bidding. for projects that include icb the borrower is required to prepare and submit to the bank a draft general procurement notice. the bank will arrange for its publication in un development business online (undb online) and in the development gateway’s dgmarket).27 the notice shall contain information concerning the borrower (or prospective borrower), amount and purpose of the loan, scope of procurement under icb, and the name, telephone (or fax) number, and address of the borrower’s agency responsible for procurement and the address of the website where specific procurement notices will be posted. if known, the scheduled date for availability of prequalification or bidding documents should be indicated. the related prequalification or bidding documents, as the case may be, shall not be released to the public earlier than the date of publication of the general procurement notice. 2.8 invitations to prequalify or to bid, as the case may be, shall be advertised as specific procurement notices in at least one newspaper of national circulation in the borrower’s 13 26 in revising the bidding documents in the second stage the borrower should respect the confidentiality of the bidders’ technical proposals used in the first stage, consistent with requirements of transparency and intellectual property rights. 27 undb is a publication of the united nations. subscription information is available from: development business, united nations, gcpo box 5850, new york, ny 10163-5850, usa (website: www.devbusiness.com; e-mail: dbsubscribe@un.org); development gateway market is an electronic portal of development gateway foundation, 1889 f street, n.w. washington, dc 20006, usa (website: www.dgmarket.com). country (or in the official gazette, or in an electronic portal with free access). such invitations shall also be published in undb online and in dgmarket. notification shall be given in sufficient time to enable prospective bidders to obtain prequalification or bidding documents and prepare and submit their responses.28 prequalification of bidders 2.9 prequalification is usually necessary for large or complex works, or in any other circumstances in which the high costs of preparing detailed bids could discourage competition, such as custom-designed equipment, industrial plant, specialized services, some complex information and technology and contracts to be let under turnkey, design and build, or management contracting. this also ensures that invitations to bid are extended only to those who have adequate capabilities and resources. prequalification shall be based entirely upon the capability and resources of prospective bidders to perform the particular contract satisfactorily, taking into account their (a) experience and past performance on similar contracts, (b) capabilities with respect to personnel, equipment, and construction or manufacturing facilities, and (c) financial position.29 2.10 the invitation to prequalify for bidding on specific contracts or groups of similar contracts shall be advertised and notified as described in paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8 above. the scope of the contract and a clear statement of the requirements for qualification shall be sent to those who responded to the invitation. all such applicants that meet the specified criteria shall be allowed to bid. borrowers shall inform all applicants of the results of prequalification. as soon as prequalification is completed, the bidding documents shall be made available to 14 28 see para. 2.44. 29 the bank has prepared a standard prequalification document for use by its borrowers, where appropriate. the qualified prospective bidders. for prequalification for groups of contracts to be awarded over a period of time, a limit for the number or total value of awards to any one bidder may be made on the basis of the bidder’s resources. the list of prequalified firms in such instances shall be updated periodically. verification of the information provided in the submission for prequalification shall be confirmed at the time of award of contract, and award may be denied to a bidder that is judged to no longer have the capability or resources to successfully perform the contract. b. bidding documents general 2.11 the bidding documents shall furnish all information necessary for a prospective bidder to prepare a bid for the goods and works to be provided. while the detail and complexity of these documents may vary with the size and nature of the proposed bid package and contract, they generally include: invitation to bid; instructions to bidders; form of bid; form of contract; conditions of contract, both general and special; specifications and drawings; relevant technical data (including of geological and environmental nature); list of goods or bill of quantities; delivery time or schedule of completion; and necessary appendices, such as formats for various securities. the basis for bid evaluation and selection of the lowest evaluated bid shall be clearly outlined in the instructions to bidders and/or the specifications. if a fee is charged for the bidding documents, it shall be reasonable and reflect only the cost of their printing and delivery to prospective bidders, and shall not be so high as to discourage qualified bidders. the borrower may use an electronic system to distribute bidding documents, provided that the bank is satisfied with the adequacy of such system. if bidding documents are distributed electronically, the electronic system shall be secure to avoid modifications to the bidding documents and shall not restrict the access of bidders to the bidding documents. guidance on 15 critical components of the bidding documents are given in the following paragraphs. 2.12 borrowers shall use the appropriate standard bidding documents (sbds) issued by the bank with minimum changes, acceptable to the bank, as necessary to address project- specific conditions. any such changes shall be introduced only through bid or contract data sheets, or through special conditions of contract, and not by introducing changes in the standard wording of the bank’s sbds. where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued, the borrower shall use other internationally recognized standard conditions of contract and contract forms acceptable to the bank. validity of bids and bid security 2.13 bidders shall be required to submit bids valid for a period specified in the bidding documents which shall be sufficient to enable the borrower to complete the comparison and evaluation of bids, review the recommendation of award with the bank (if required in the procurement plan), and obtain all the necessary approvals so that the contract can be awarded within that period. 2.14 borrowers have the option of requiring a bid security. when used, the bid security shall be in the amount and form specified in the bidding documents30 and shall remain valid for a period of four weeks beyond the validity period for the bids, in order to provide reasonable time for the borrower to act if the security is to be called. bid security shall be released to unsuccessful bidders once the contract has been signed with the winning bidder. in place of a bid security, the borrower may require bidders to sign a declaration 16 30 the format of the bid security shall be in accordance with the standard bidding documents and shall be issued by a reputable bank or financial institution selected by the bidder. if the institution issuing the security is located outside the country of the borrower, it shall have a correspondent financial institution located in the country of borrower to make it enforceable. accepting that if they withdraw or modify their bids during the period of validity or they are awarded the contract and they fail to sign the contract or to submit a performance security before the deadline defined in the bidding documents, the bidder will be suspended for a period of time from being eligible for bidding in any contract with the borrower. language 2.15 prequalification and bidding documents and the bids shall be prepared in one of the following languages, selected by the borrower: english, french, or spanish. the contract signed with the winning bidder shall be written in the language so selected for the bidding documents, and this language shall be the one that governs the contractual relations between the borrower and the winning bidder. in addition to being prepared in english, french, or spanish, the prequalification and bidding documents may, at the borrower’s option, also be prepared in the national language of the borrower’s country (or the language used nation-wide in the borrower’s country for commercial transactions).31 if the prequalification and bidding documents are prepared in two languages, bidders shall be permitted to submit their bids in either of these two languages. in such case, the contract signed with the winning bidder shall be written in the language in which its bid was submitted, in which case this language shall be the one that governs the contractual relations between the borrower and the winning bidder. if the contract is signed in a language other than english, french, or spanish, and the contract is subject to bank’s prior review, the borrower shall provide the bank with a translation of the contract in the internationally used language in which the bidding documents were prepared. bidders shall not be required nor permitted to sign contracts in two languages. 17 31 the bank shall be satisfied with the language to be used. clarity of bidding documents 2.16 bidding documents shall be so worded as to permit and encourage international competition and shall set forth clearly and precisely the work to be carried out, the location of the work, the goods to be supplied, the place of delivery or installation, the schedule for delivery or completion, minimum performance requirements, and the warranty and maintenance requirements, as well as any other pertinent terms and conditions. in addition, the bidding documents, where appropriate, shall define the tests, standards, and methods that will be employed to judge the conformity of equipment as delivered, or works as performed, with the specifications. drawings shall be consistent with the text of the specifications, and an order of precedence between the two shall be specified. 2.17 the bidding documents shall specify any factors, in addition to price, which will be taken into account in evaluating bids, and how such factors will be quantified or otherwise evaluated. if bids based on alternative designs, materials, completion schedules, payment terms, etc., are permitted, conditions for their acceptability and the method of their evaluation shall be expressly stated. 2.18 all prospective bidders shall be provided the same information, and shall be assured of equal opportunities to obtain additional information on a timely basis. borrowers shall provide reasonable access to project sites for visits by prospective bidders. for works or complex supply contracts, particularly for those requiring refurbishing existing works or equipment, a pre-bid conference may be arranged whereby potential bidders may meet with the borrower representatives to seek clarifications (in person or online). minutes of the conference shall be 18 provided to all prospective bidders with a copy to the bank (in hard copy or sent electronically). any additional information, clarification, correction of errors, or modifications of bidding documents shall be sent to each recipient of the original bidding documents in sufficient time before the deadline for receipt of bids to enable bidders to take appropriate actions. if necessary, the deadline shall be extended. the bank shall receive a copy (in hard copy format or sent electronically) and be consulted for issuing a “no objection” when the contract is subject to prior review. standards 2.19 standards and technical specifications quoted in bidding documents shall promote the broadest possible competition, while assuring the critical performance or other requirements for the goods and/or works under procurement. as far as possible, the borrower shall specify internationally accepted standards such as those issued by the international standards organization with which the equipment or materials or workmanship shall comply. where such international standards are unavailable or are inappropriate, national standards may be specified. in all cases, the bidding documents shall state that equipment, material, or workmanship meeting other standards, which promise at least substantial equivalence, will also be accepted. use of brand names 2.20 specifications shall be based on relevant characteristics and/or performance requirements. references to brand names, catalog numbers, or similar classifications shall be avoided. if it is necessary to quote a brand name or catalog number of a particular manufacturer to clarify an otherwise incomplete specification, the words “or 19 equivalent” shall be added after such reference. the specification shall permit the acceptance of offers for goods which have similar characteristics and which provide performance at least substantially equivalent to those specified. pricing 2.21 bids for goods shall be invited on the basis of cip32 (place of destination) for all goods manufactured abroad, including those previously imported, and exw33 (ex works, ex factory, or off-the-shelf) plus cost of inland transportation and insurance to the place of destination for goods manufactured or assembled in the country of the borrower. bidders shall be allowed to arrange for ocean and other transportation and related insurance from any eligible source.34 where installation, commissioning, or other similar services are required to be performed by the bidder, as in the case of “supply and installation” contracts, the bidder shall be required to quote for these services, in addition. 2.22 in the case of turnkey contracts, the bidder shall be required to quote the price of the installed plant at site, including all costs for supply of equipment, marine and local 20 32 refer to incoterms 2000 for further definitions. published by the international chamber of commerce, 38 cours albert 1er, 75008 paris, france. cip is carriage and insurance paid to (named place of destination). this term may be used irrespective of the mode of transport, including multimodal transport. cip term is for custom duties and other import taxes unpaid, payment for which is the responsibility of the borrower, either for goods previously imported or that will be imported. for previously imported goods, the quoted cip price shall be distinguishable from the original import value of these goods declared to customs and shall include any rebate or mark-up of the local agent or representative and all local costs except import duties and taxes, which will be paid by the purchaser. 33 the exw price shall include all duties, sales, and other taxes already paid or payable for the components and raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of the equipment, offered in the bid. 34 see para. 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8. transportation and insurance, installation, and commissioning, as well as associated works and all other services included in the scope of contract such as design, maintenance, operation, etc. unless otherwise specified in the bidding documents, the turnkey price shall include all duties, taxes, and other levies.35 2.23 bidders for works contracts shall be required to quote unit prices or lump sum prices for the performance of the works, and such prices shall include all duties, taxes, and other levies. bidders shall be allowed to obtain all inputs (except for unskilled labor) from any eligible source so that they may offer their most competitive bids. price adjustment 2.24 bidding documents shall state either that (a) bid prices will be fixed or (b) that price adjustments will be made to reflect any changes (upwards or downwards) in major cost components of the contract, such as labor, equipment, materials, and fuel. price adjustment provisions are usually not necessary in simple contracts involving delivery of goods or completion of works within eighteen months, but shall be included in contracts which extend beyond eighteen months. however, it is normal commercial practice to obtain firm prices for some types of equipment regardless of the delivery time and, in such cases, price adjustment provisions are not needed. 2.25 prices may be adjusted by the use of a prescribed formula (or formulae) which breaks down the total price into components that are adjusted by price indices specified for each component or, alternatively, on the basis of documentary evidence (including actual invoices) provided by the supplier or contractor. the use of the formula method of 21 35 goods in bids for turnkey contracts may be invited on the basis of ddp (named place of destination) and bidders should be free to choose the best arrangement between imported goods or goods manufactured in the country of the borrower, in the preparation of their bids. price adjustment is preferable to that of documentary evidence. the method to be used, the formula (if applicable), and the base date for application shall be clearly defined in the bidding documents. if the payment currency is different from the source of the input and corresponding index, a correction factor shall be applied in the formula, to avoid incorrect adjustment. transportation and insurance 2.26 bidding documents shall permit suppliers and contractors to arrange transportation and insurance from any eligible source. bidding documents shall state the types and terms of insurance to be provided by the bidder. the indemnity payable under transportation insurance shall be at least 110 percent of the contract amount in the currency of the contract or in a freely convertible currency to enable prompt replacement of lost or damaged goods. for works, a contractor’s all risk form of policy usually shall be specified. for large projects with several contractors on a site, a “wrap-up” or total project insurance arrangement may be obtained by the borrower, in which case the borrower shall seek competition for such insurance. 2.27 as an exception, if a borrower wishes to reserve transportation and insurance for the import of goods to national companies or other designated sources, bidders shall be asked to quote fca (named place) or cpt (named place of destination)36 prices in addition to the cip (place of destination) price specified in paragraph 2.21. selection of the lowest evaluated bid shall be on the basis of the cip (place of destination) price, but the borrower may sign the contract on fca or cpt terms and make its own arrangement for transportation and/or insurance. under such circumstances, the contract shall be limited to the fca or cpt cost. if the borrower does not wish to obtain 22 36 incoterms 2000 for free carrier (named place) and for carriage paid to (named place of destination), respectively. insurance coverage in the market, evidence shall be provided to the bank that resources are readily available for prompt payment in a freely convertible currency of the indemnities required to replace lost or damaged goods. currency provisions 2.28 bidding documents shall state the currency or currencies in which bidders are to state their prices, the procedure for conversion of prices expressed in different currencies into a single currency for the purpose of comparing bids, and the currencies in which the contract price will be paid. the following provisions (paragraphs 2.29-2.33) are intended to (a) ensure that bidders have the opportunity to minimize any exchange risk with regard to the currency of bid and of payment, and hence may offer their best prices; (b) give bidders in countries with weak currencies the option to use a stronger currency and thus provide a firmer basis for their bid price; and (c) ensure fairness and transparency in the evaluation process. currency of bid 2.29 bidding documents shall state that the bidder may express the bid price in any currency. if the bidder wishes to express the bid price as a sum of amounts in different foreign currencies, they may do so, provided the price includes no more than three foreign currencies. furthermore, the borrower may require bidders to state the portion of the bid price representing local costs incurred in the currency37 of the country of the borrower. 2.30 in bidding documents for works, the borrower may require bidders to state the bid price entirely in the local currency, along with the requirements for payments in up to three foreign currencies of their choice for expected inputs from outside the borrower’s country, expressed as a percentage of the bid price, 23 37 referred to hereafter as local currency. together with the exchange rates used in such calculations. currency conversion for bid comparison 2.31 the bid price is the sum of all payments in various currencies required by the bidder. for the purpose of comparing prices, bid prices shall be converted to a single currency selected by the borrower (local currency or fully convertible foreign currency) and stated in the bidding documents. the borrower shall make this conversion by using the selling (exchange) rates for those currencies quoted by an official source (such as the central bank) or by a commercial bank or by an internationally circulated newspaper for similar transactions on a date selected in advance, such source and date to be specified in the bidding documents, provided that the date shall not be earlier than four weeks prior to the deadline for the receipt of bids, nor later than the original date for the expiry of the period of bid validity. currency of payment 2.32 payment of the contract price shall be made in the currency or currencies in which the bid price is expressed in the bid of the successful bidder. 2.33 when the bid price is required to be stated in the local currency but the bidder has requested payment in foreign currencies expressed as a percentage of the bid price, the exchange rates to be used for purposes of payments shall be those specified by the bidder in the bid, so as to ensure that the value of the foreign currency portions of the bid is maintained without any loss or gain. terms and methods of payment 2.34 payment terms shall be in accordance with the international commercial practices applicable to the specific goods and works. (a) contracts for supply of goods shall provide for full payment on the delivery and inspection, if so required, of the contracted goods except for 24 contracts involving installation and commissioning, in which case a portion of the payment may be made after the supplier has complied with all its obligations under the contract. the use of letters of credit is encouraged so as to assure prompt payment to the supplier. in major contracts for equipment and plant, provision shall be made for suitable advances and, in contracts of long duration, for progress payments during the period of manufacture or assembly. (b) contracts for works shall provide in appropriate cases for mobilization advances, advances on contractor’s equipment and materials, regular progress payments, and reasonable retention amounts to be released upon compliance with the contractor’s obligations under contract. 2.35 any advance payment for mobilization and similar expenses, made upon signature of a contract for goods or works, shall be related to the estimated amount of these expenses and be specified in the bidding documents. amounts and timing of other advances to be made, such as for materials delivered to the site for incorporation in the works, shall also be specified. the bidding documents shall specify the arrangements for any security required for advance payments. 2.36 bidding documents shall specify the payment method and terms offered, whether alternative payment methods and terms will be allowed and, if so, how the terms will affect bid evaluation. alternative bids 2.37 the bidding documents shall clearly indicate when bidders are allowed to submit alternative bids, how alternative bids should be submitted, how bid prices should be offered and the basis on which alternative bids shall be evaluated. 25 conditions of contract 2.38 the contract documents shall clearly define the scope of work to be performed, the goods to be supplied, the rights and obligations of the borrower and of the supplier or contractor, and the functions and authority of the engineer, architect, or construction manager, if one is employed by the borrower, in the supervision and administration of the contract. in addition to the general conditions of contract, any special conditions particular to the specific goods or works to be procured and the location of the project shall be included. the conditions of contract shall provide a balanced allocation of risks and liabilities. performance security 2.39 bidding documents for works shall require security in an amount sufficient to protect the borrower in case of breach of contract by the contractor. this security shall be provided in an appropriate form and amount, as specified by the borrower in the bidding document.38 the amount of the security may vary, depending on the type of security furnished and on the nature and magnitude of the works. a portion of this security shall extend sufficiently beyond the date of completion of the works to cover the defects liability or maintenance period up to final acceptance by the borrower; alternatively, contracts may provide for a percentage of each periodic payment to be held as retention money until final acceptance. contractors may be allowed to replace retention money with an equivalent security after provisional acceptance. 2.40 in contracts for the supply of goods, the need for performance security depends on the market conditions and commercial practice for the particular kind of goods. suppliers or 26 38 the format of the performance security shall be in accordance with the standard bidding documents and shall be issued by a reputable bank or financial institution selected by the bidder. if the institution issuing the security is located outside the country of the borrower, it shall have a correspondent financial institution located in the country of borrower to make it enforceable. manufacturers may be required to provide a guarantee to protect against nonperformance of the contract. such security in an appropriate amount may also cover warranty obligations or, alternatively, a percentage of the payments may be held as retention money to cover warranty obligations, and any installation or commissioning requirements. the security or retention money shall be reasonable in amount. liquidated damages and bonus clauses 2.41 provisions for liquidated damages or similar provisions in an appropriate amount shall be included in the conditions of contract when delays in the delivery of goods, completion of works or failure of the goods or works to meet performance requirements would result in extra cost, or loss of revenue or loss of other benefits to the borrower. provision may also be made for a bonus to be paid to suppliers or contractors for completion of works or delivery of goods ahead of the times specified in the contract when such earlier completion or delivery would be of benefit to the borrower. force majeure 2.42 the conditions of contract shall stipulate that failure on the part of the parties to perform their obligations under the contract will not be considered a default if such failure is the result of an event of force majeure as defined in the conditions of contract. applicable law and settlement of disputes 2.43 the conditions of contract shall include provisions dealing with the applicable law and the forum for the settlement of disputes. international commercial arbitration has practical advantages over other methods for the settlement of disputes. therefore, the bank 27 recommends that borrowers use this type of arbitration in contracts for the procurement of goods and works. the bank shall not be named arbitrator or be asked to name an arbitrator.39 in case of works contracts, supply and installation contracts, and turnkey contracts, the dispute settlement provision shall also include mechanisms such as dispute review boards or adjudicators, which are designed to permit a speedier dispute settlement. c. bid opening, evaluation, and award of contract time for preparation of bids 2.44 the time allowed for the preparation and submission of bids shall be determined with due consideration of the particular circumstances of the project and the magnitude and complexity of the contract. generally, not less than six weeks from the date of the invitation to bid or the date of availability of bidding documents, whichever is later, shall be allowed for icb. where large works or complex items of equipment are involved, this period shall generally be not less than twelve weeks to enable prospective bidders to conduct investigations before submitting their bids. in such cases, the borrower is encouraged to convene pre-bid conferences and arrange site visits. bidders shall be permitted to submit bids by mail or by hand. borrowers may also use electronic systems permitting bidders to submit bids by electronic means, provided the bank is satisfied with the adequacy of the system, including, inter alia, that the system is secure, maintains the confidentiality and authenticity of bids submitted, uses an electronic signature system or equivalent to keep bidders bound to their bids, and only allows bids to be opened with due simultaneous electronic authorization of the bidder and the borrower. in this case, 28 39 it is understood, however, that officials of the international centre for settlement of investment disputes (icsid) shall remain free to name arbitrators in their capacity as icsid officials. bidders shall continue to have the option to submit their bids in hard copy. the deadline and place for receipt of bids shall be specified in the invitation to bid. bid opening procedures 2.45 the time for the bid opening shall be the same as for the deadline for receipt of bids or promptly40 thereafter, and shall be announced, together with the place for bid opening, in the invitation to bid. the borrower shall open all bids at the stipulated time and place. bids shall be opened in public; bidders or their representatives shall be allowed to be present (in person or online, when electronic bidding is used). the name of the bidder and total amount of each bid, and of any alternative bids if they have been requested or permitted, shall be read aloud (and posted online when electronic bidding is used) and recorded when opened and a copy of this record shall be promptly sent to the bank and to all bidders who submitted bids in time. bids received after the time stipulated, as well as those not opened and read out at bid opening, shall not be considered. clarifications or alterations of bids 2.46 except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 2.63 and 2.64 of these guidelines, bidders shall not be requested or permitted to alter their bids after the deadline for receipt of bids. the borrower shall ask bidders for clarification needed to evaluate their bids but shall not ask or permit bidders to change the substance or price of their bids after the bid opening. requests for clarification and the bidders’ responses shall be made in writing, in hard copy or by an electronic system satisfactory to the bank.41 confidentiality 2.47 after the public opening of bids, information relating to the examination, 29 40 to allow sufficient time to take the bids to the place announced for public bid opening. 41 see paragraph 2.44 clarification, and evaluation of bids and recommendations concerning awards shall not be disclosed to bidders or other persons not officially concerned with this process until the publication of contract award. examination of bids 2.48 the borrower shall ascertain whether the bids (a) meet the eligibility requirements specified in paragraph 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 of these guidelines, (b) have been properly signed, (c) are accompanied by the required securities or required declaration signed as specified in paragraph 2.14 of the guidelines, (d) are substantially responsive to the bidding documents, and (v) are otherwise generally in order. if a bid is not substantially responsive, that is, it contains material deviations from or reservations to the terms, conditions, and specifications in the bidding documents, it shall not be considered further. the bidder shall not be permitted to correct or withdraw material deviations or reservations once bids have been opened.42 evaluation and comparison of bids 2.49 the purpose of bid evaluation is to determine the cost to the borrower of each bid in a manner that permits a comparison on the basis of their evaluated cost. subject to paragraph 2.58, the bid with the lowest evaluated cost,43 but not necessarily the lowest submitted price, shall be selected for award. 2.50 the bid price read out at the bid opening shall be adjusted to correct any arithmetical errors. also, for the purpose of evaluation, adjustments shall be made for any quantifiable nonmaterial deviations or reservations. price adjustment provisions applying to the period of implementation of the contract shall not be taken into account in the evaluation. 2.51 the evaluation and comparison of bids shall be on cip (place of destination) prices for 30 42 see para. 2.50 regarding corrections. 43 see para. 2.52. the supply of imported goods44 and exw prices, plus cost of inland transportation and insurance to the place of destination, for goods manufactured within the borrower’s country, together with prices for any required installation, training, commissioning, and other similar services.45 2.52 bidding documents shall also specify the relevant factors in addition to price to be considered in bid evaluation and the manner in which they will be applied for the purpose of determining the lowest evaluated bid. for goods and equipment, other factors may be taken into consideration including, among others, payment schedule, delivery time, operating costs, efficiency and compatibility of the equipment, availability of service and spare parts, and related training, safety, and environmental benefits. the factors other than price to be used for determining the lowest evaluated bid shall, to the extent practicable, be expressed in monetary terms, or given a relative weight in the evaluation provisions in the bidding documents. 2.53 under works and turnkey contracts, contractors are responsible for all duties, taxes, and other levies,46 and bidders shall take these factors into account in preparing their bids. the evaluation and comparison of bids shall be on this basis. bid evaluation for works shall be strictly in monetary terms. any procedure under which bids above or below a predetermined assessment of bid values are 31 44 borrowers may ask for prices on a cif basis (and bids compared on that same basis) only when the goods are carried by sea and the goods are not containerized. cif shall not be used for anything other than sea transport. in the case of manufactured goods, it is unlikely that the choice of cif will be appropriate, because these goods are usually containerized. cip can be used for any mode of transport, including sea and multimodal transport. 45 the evaluation of bids shall not take into account: (a) customs duties and other taxes levied on imported goods quoted cip (which are excluded of custom duties); (b) sales and similar taxes levied in connection with the sale or delivery of the goods 46 unless bidding documents specify otherwise for some turnkey contracts (see para. 2.22 ). automatically disqualified is not acceptable. if time is a critical factor, the value of early completion to the borrower may be taken into account according to criteria presented in the bidding documents, only if the conditions of contract provide for commensurate penalties for noncompliance. 2.54 the borrower shall prepare a detailed report on the evaluation and comparison of bids setting forth the specific reasons on which the recommendation is based for the award of the contract. domestic preferences 2.55 at the request of the borrower, and under conditions to be agreed under the loan agreement and set forth in the bidding documents, a margin of preference may be provided in the evaluation of bids for: (a) goods manufactured in the country of the borrower when comparing bids offering such goods with those offering goods manufactured abroad; and (b) works in member countries below a specified threshold of gnp47 per capita, when comparing bids from eligible domestic contractors with those from foreign firms. 2.56 where preference for domestically manufactured goods or for domestic contractors is allowed, the methods and stages set forth in appendix 2 to these guidelines shall be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids. extension of validity of bids 2.57 borrowers shall complete evaluation of bids and award of contract within the initial period of bid validity so that extensions are not necessary. an extension of bid validity, if justified by exceptional circumstances, shall be requested in writing from all bidders before the expiration date. the extension shall be for the 32 47 gross national product as defined annually by the bank. minimum period required to complete the evaluation, obtain the necessary approvals, and award the contract. in the case of fixed price contracts, requests for second and subsequent extensions will be permissible only if the request for extension provides for an appropriate adjustment mechanism of the quoted price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of extension. whenever an extension of bid validity period is requested, bidders shall not be requested or be permitted to change the quoted (base) price or other conditions of their bid. bidders shall have the right to refuse to grant such an extension. if the bidding documents require a bid security, bidders may exercise their right to refuse to grant such an extension without forfeiting their bid security, but those who are willing to extend the validity of their bid shall be required to provide a suitable extension of bid security. postqualification of bidders 2.58 if bidders have not been prequalified, the borrower shall determine whether the bidder whose bid has been determined to offer the lowest evaluated cost has the capability and resources to effectively carry out the contract as offered in the bid. the criteria to be met shall be set out in the bidding documents, and if the bidder does not meet them, the bid shall be rejected. in such an event, the borrower shall make a similar determination for the next- lowest evaluated bidder. award of contract 2.59 the borrower shall award the contract, within the period of the validity of bids, to the bidder who meets the appropriate standards of capability and resources and whose bid has been determined (i) to be substantially responsive to the bidding documents and (ii) to offer the lowest evaluated cost.48 a bidder shall not be required, as a condition of award, to undertake responsibilities for work not 33 48 referred to as “lowest evaluated bidder” and “lowest evaluated bid,” respectively. stipulated in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify the bid as originally submitted. publication of the award of contract 2.60 within two weeks of receiving the bank’s “no objection” to the recommendation of contract award, the borrower shall publish in undb online and in dgmarket the results identifying the bid and lot numbers and the following information: (a) name of each bidder who submitted a bid; (b) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (c) name and evaluated prices of each bid that was evaluated; (d) name of bidders whose bids were rejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (e) name of the winning bidder, and the price it offered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded. rejection of all bids 2.61 bidding documents usually provide that borrowers may reject all bids. rejection of all bids is justified when there is lack of effective competition, or bids are not substantially responsive or when bid prices are substantially higher than existing budget. lack of competition shall not be determined solely on the basis of the number of bidders. even when only one bid is submitted, the bidding process may be considered valid, if the bid was satisfactorily advertised and prices are reasonable in comparison to market values. borrowers may, after the bank’s prior approval, reject all bids. if all bids are rejected, the borrower shall review the causes justifying the rejection and consider making revisions to the conditions of contract, design and specifications, scope of the contract, or a combination of these, before inviting new bids. 2.62 if the rejection of all bids is due to lack of competition, wider advertising shall be considered. if the rejection is due to most or all of the bids being nonresponsive, new bids may be invited from the initially prequalified firms, or with the agreement of the bank from only those that submitted bids in the first instance. 34 2.63 all bids shall not be rejected and new bids invited on the same bidding and contract documents solely for the purpose of obtaining lower prices. if the lowest evaluated responsive bid exceeds the borrower’s pre-bid cost estimates by a substantial margin, the borrower shall investigate causes for the excessive cost and consider requesting new bids as described in the previous paragraphs. alternatively, the borrower may negotiate with the lowest evaluated bidder to try to obtain a satisfactory contract through a reduction in the scope and/or a reallocation of risk and responsibility which can be reflected in a reduction of the contract price. however, substantial reduction in the scope or modification to the contract documents may require rebidding. 2.64 the bank’s prior approval shall be obtained before rejecting all bids, soliciting new bids, or entering into negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder. debriefing 2.65 in the publication of contract award referred to in paragraph 2.60 the borrower shall specify that any bidder who wishes to ascertain the grounds on which its bid was not selected, should request an explanation from the borrower. the borrower shall promptly provide an explanation of why such bid was not selected, either in writing and/or in a debriefing meeting, at the option of the borrower. the requesting bidder shall bear all the costs of attending such a debriefing. d. modified icb operations involving a program of imports49 2.66 where the loan provides financing for a program of imports, icb with simplified advertising and currency provisions may be 35 49 also see para. 3.11. used for large-value contracts, as defined in the loan agreement.50 2.67 the simplified provisions for notification of icb procurement do not require a general procurement notice. specific procurement notices shall be inserted in at least one newspaper of national circulation in the borrower’s country (or in the official gazette, if any, or in an electronic portal with free access) in addition to undb online and dgmarket. the period allowed for submission of bids may be reduced to four weeks. bidding and payment may be limited to one currency widely used in international trade. procurement of commodities 2.68 market prices of commodities, such as grain, animal feed, cooking oil, fuel, fertilizer, and metals, fluctuate, depending upon the demand and supply at any particular time. many are quoted in established commodity markets. procurement often involves multiple awards for partial quantities to assure security of supply and multiple purchases over a period of time to take advantage of favorable market conditions and to keep inventories low. a list of prequalified bidders may be drawn up to whom periodic invitations are issued. bidders may be invited to quote prices linked to the market price at the time of or prior to the shipments. bid validities shall be as short as possible. a single currency in which the commodity is usually priced in the market, may be used for bidding and payment. the currency shall be specified in the bidding document. bidding documents may permit telexed or faxed bids or bids submitted by electronic means, and in such cases either no bid security is required, or standing bid securities valid over a specified period of time have been submitted by prequalified bidders. standard contract conditions and forms consistent with market practices shall be used. 36 50 procurement of smaller contracts is normally carried out in accordance with procedures followed by the private or public entity handling the imports, or other established commercial practices acceptable to the bank, as described in para. 3.12. iii. other methods of procurement general 3.1 this section describes the methods of procurement that can be used where icb would not be the most economic and efficient method of procurement, and where other methods are deemed more appropriate.51 the bank’s policies with respect to margins of preference for domestically manufactured goods and works contracts do not apply to methods of procurement other than icb. paragraphs 3.2 to 3.7 describe the generally used methods in descending order of preference and the remaining paragraphs the methods used in specific circumstances. limited international bidding 3.2 limited international bidding (lib) is essentially icb by direct invitation without open advertisement. it may be an appropriate method of procurement where (a) there is only a limited number of suppliers, or (b) other exceptional reasons may justify departure from full icb procedures. under lib, borrowers shall seek bids from a list of potential suppliers broad enough to assure competitive prices, such list to include all suppliers when there are only a limited number. domestic preferences are not applicable in the evaluation of bids under lib. in all respects other than advertisement and preferences, icb procedures shall apply, including the publication of the award of contract as indicated in paragraph 2.60. national competitive bidding 3.3 national competitive bidding (ncb) is the competitive bidding procedure normally used for public procurement in the country of 37 51 contracts shall not be divided into smaller units in order to make them less attractive for icb procedures; any proposal to divide a contract into smaller packages shall require the prior approval of the bank. the borrower, and may be the most appropriate way of procuring goods or works which, by their nature or scope, are unlikely to attract foreign competition. to be acceptable for use in bank-financed procurement, these procedures shall be reviewed and modified52 as necessary to assure economy, efficiency, transparency, and broad consistency with the provisions included in section i of these guidelines. ncb may be the most appropriate method of procurement where foreign bidders are not expected to be interested because (a) the contract values are small, (b) works are scattered geographically or spread over time, (c) works are labor intensive, or (d) the goods or works are available locally at prices below the international market. ncb procedures may also be used where the advantages of icb are clearly outweighed by the administrative or financial burden involved. 3.4 advertising may be limited to the national press or official gazette, or a free and open access website. bidding documents may be only in a national language of the borrower’s country (or the language used nation-wide in the borrower’s country for commercial transactions), and the currency of the country of the borrower is generally used for the purposes of bidding and payment. in addition, the bidding documents shall provide clear instructions on how bids should be submitted, how prices should be offered, and the place and time for submission of bids. adequate response time for preparation and submission of bids shall be provided. the procedures shall provide for adequate competition in order to ensure reasonable prices, and methods used in the evaluation of bids and the award of contracts shall be objective and made known to all bidders in the bidding documents and not be applied arbitrarily. the procedures shall also include public opening of bids, publication of results of evaluation and of the award of contract and 38 52 any such modification shall be reflected in the loan agreement. provisions for bidders to protest. if foreign firms wish to participate under these circumstances, they shall be allowed to do so. shopping 3.5 shopping is a procurement method based on comparing price quotations obtained from several suppliers (in the case of goods) or from several contractors (in the case of civil works), with a minimum of three, to assure competitive prices, and is an appropriate method for procuring readily available off-the- shelf goods or standard specification commodities of small value, or simple civil works of small value. requests for quotations shall indicate the description and quantity of the goods or specifications of works, as well as desired delivery (or completion) time and place. quotations may be submitted by letter, facsimile or by electronic means. the evaluation of quotations shall follow the same principles as of open bidding. the terms of the accepted offer shall be incorporated in a purchase order or brief contract. direct contracting 3.6 direct contracting is contracting without competition (single source) and may be an appropriate method under the following circumstances: (a) an existing contract for goods or works, awarded in accordance with procedures acceptable to the bank, may be extended for additional goods or works of a similar nature. the bank shall be satisfied in such cases that no advantage could be obtained by further competition and that the prices on the extended contract are reasonable. provisions for such an extension, if considered likely in advance, shall be included in the original contract. (b) standardization of equipment or spare parts, to be compatible with existing equipment, may justify additional purchases from the original supplier. 39 for such purchases to be justified, the original equipment shall be suitable, the number of new items shall generally be less than the existing number, the price shall be reasonable, and the advantages of another make or source of equipment shall have been considered and rejected on grounds acceptable to the bank. (c) the required equipment is proprietary and obtainable only from one source. (d) the contractor responsible for a process design requires the purchase of critical items from a particular supplier as a condition of a performance guarantee. (e) in exceptional cases, such as in response to natural disasters. 3.7 after the contract signature, the borrower shall publish in undb online and in dgmarket the name of the contractor, price, duration, and summary scope of the contract. this publication may be done quarterly and in the format of a summarized table covering the previous period. force account 3.8 force account, that is, construction by the use of the borrower’s own personnel and equipment,53 may be the only practical method for constructing some kinds of works. the use of force account may be justified where: (a) quantities of work involved cannot be defined in advance; (b) works are small and scattered or in remote locations for which qualified construction firms are unlikely to bid at reasonable prices; 40 53 a government-owned construction unit that is not managerially and financially autonomous shall be considered a force account unit. “force account” is otherwise known as “direct labor,” “departmental forces,” or “direct work.” (c) work is required to be carried out without disrupting ongoing operations; (d) risks of unavoidable work interruption are better borne by the borrower than by a contractor; and (e) there are emergencies needing prompt attention. procurement from united nations agencies 3.9 there may be situations in which procurement directly from specialized agencies of the united nations (un), acting as suppliers, pursuant to their own procedures, may be the most appropriate way of procuring: (a) small quantities of off-the-shelf goods, primarily in the fields of education and health; and (b) specialized products where the number of suppliers is limited such as for vaccines or drugs. procurement agents 3.10 where borrowers lack the necessary organization, resources, and experience, borrowers may wish (or be required by the bank) to employ, as their agent, a firm specializing in handling procurement. the agent shall follow all the procurement procedures provided for in the loan agreement and as further elaborated in the procurement plan approved by the bank on behalf of the borrower, including use of bank sbds, review procedures, and documentation. this also applies in cases where un agencies act as procurement agents.54 management contractors may be employed in a similar manner for a fee to contract for miscellaneous works involving reconstruction, repairs, rehabilitation, and new construction in 41 54 the consultant guidelines shall apply for the selection of procurement and inspection agents. the cost or fee of the procurement or inspection agent is eligible for financing from the bank loan, if so provided in the loan agreement and in the procurement plan , and provided the terms and conditions of selection and employment are acceptable to the bank. emergency situations, or where large numbers of small contracts are involved. inspection agents 3.11 preshipment inspection and certification of imports is one of the safeguards for the borrower, particularly where the country has a large import program. the inspection and certification usually covers quality, quantity, and reasonableness of price. imports procured through icb procedures shall not be subject to price verification, but only verification for quality and quantity. however, imports not procured through icb may additionally be subjected to price verification. the inspection agents are ordinarily paid for on a fee basis levied on the value of the goods. costs for certification of imports shall not be considered in the evaluation of bids under icb. procurement in loans to financial intermediaries 3.12 where the loan provides funds to an intermediary institution such as an agricultural credit institution or a development finance company, to be re-lent to beneficiaries such as individuals, private sector enterprises, small and medium enterprises, or autonomous commercial enterprises in the public sector for the partial financing of subprojects, the procurement is usually undertaken by the respective beneficiaries in accordance with established private sector or commercial practices, which are acceptable to the bank. however, even in these situations, icb may be the most appropriate procurement method for the purchase of large single items or in cases where large quantities of like goods can be grouped together for bulk purchasing. 42 procurement under boo/bot/boot, concessions and similar private sector arrangements 3.13 where the bank is participating in financing the cost of a project procured under a boo/bot/ boot,55 concessions or similar type of private sector arrangement, either of the following procurement procedures shall be used, as provided for in the loan agreement and further elaborated in the procurement plan approved by the bank: (a) the concessionaire or entrepreneur under the boo/bot/ boot or similar type of contract56 shall be selected under icb procedures acceptable to the bank, which may include several stages in order to arrive at the optimal combination of evaluation criteria, such as the cost and magnitude of the financing offered, the performance specifications of the facilities offered, the cost charged to the user or purchaser, other income generated for the borrower or purchaser by the facility, and the period of the facility’s depreciation. the said entrepreneur selected in this manner shall then be free to procure the goods, works, and services required for the facility from eligible sources, using its own procedures. in this case, the project appraisal document, and the loan agreement shall specify the type of expenditures incurred by the said entrepreneur towards which bank financing will apply. or, (b) if the said concessionaire or entrepreneur has not been selected in the manner set forth in subparagraph 43 55 boo: build, own, operate; bot: build, operate, transfer; boot: build, own, operate, transfer. 56 for projects such as toll roads, tunnels, harbors, bridges, power stations, waste disposal plants, and water distribution systems. (a) above, the goods, works, or services required for the facility and to be financed by the bank shall be procured in accordance with icb procedures defined in section ii. performance-based procurement 3.14 performance based procurement,57 also called output-based procurement, refers to competitive procurement processes (icb or ncb) resulting in a contractual relationship where payments are made for measured outputs instead of the traditional way where inputs are measured. the technical specifications define the desired result and which outputs will be measured including how they will be measured. those outputs aim at satisfying a functional need both in terms of quality, quantity and reliability. payment is made in accordance with the quantity of outputs delivered, subject to their delivery at the level of quality required. reductions from payments (or retentions) may be made for lower-quality level of outputs and, in certain cases, premiums may be paid for higher quality level of outputs. the bidding documents do not normally prescribe the inputs, nor a work method for the contractor. the contractor is free to propose the most appropriate solution, based on mature and well proven experience and shall demonstrate that the level of quality specified in the bidding documents will be achieved. 3.15 performance based procurement (or output based procurement) can involve: (a) the provision of services to be paid on the basis of outputs; (b) design, supply, construction (or rehabilitation) and commissioning of a facility to be operated by the borrower; or (c) design, supply, construction (or rehabilitation) of a 44 57 the use of performance based procurement in bank financed projects should be the result of the satisfactory technical analysis of the different options available and should be either included in the pad or subject to prior approval by the bank for incorporation into the procurement plan. facility and provision of services for its operation and maintenance for a defined period of years after its commissioning.58 for the cases where design, supply and/or construction are required, prequalification is normally required and the use of two-stage bidding as indicated in paragraph 2.6 shall apply. procurement under loans guaranteed by the bank 3.16 if the bank guarantees the repayment of a loan made by another lender, the goods and works financed by the said loan shall be procured with due attention to economy and efficiency and in accordance with procedures which meet the requirements of paragraph 1.5. community participation in procurement 3.17 where, in the interest of project sustainability, or to achieve certain specific social objectives of the project, it is desirable in selected project components to (a) call for the participation of local communities and/or nongovernmental organizations (ngos) in the delivery of services, or (b) increase the utilization of local know-how and materials, or (c) employ labor-intensive and other appropriate technologies, the procurement procedures, specifications, and contract packaging shall be suitably adapted to reflect these considerations, provided these are efficient and are acceptable to the bank. the procedures proposed and the project components to be carried out by community participation shall be outlined in loan agreement and further elaborated in the procurement plan or the relevant project implementation document approved by the bank. 45 58 examples of such type of procurement are: (i) for the case of procurement of services: provision of medical services, i.e. payments for specific services, like office visits, or defined laboratory tests, etc. ; (ii) for the case of procurement of a facility: design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of a thermal power plant to be operated by the borrower; (iii) for the case of procurement of a facility and services: design, procurement, construction (or rehabilitation) of a road and operation and maintenance of the road for 5 years after construction. appendix 1: review by the bank of procurement decisions scheduling of procurement 1. the bank shall review the procurement arrangements proposed by the borrower in the procurement plan for its conformity with the loan agreement and these guidelines. the procurement plan shall cover an initial period of at least 18 months. the borrower shall update the procurement plan on an annual basis or as needed always covering the next 18 months period of project implementation. any revisions proposed to the procurement plan shall be furnished to the bank for its prior approval. prior review 2. with respect to all contracts59 which are subject to the bank’s prior review: (a) in cases where prequalification is used, the borrower shall, before prequalification submissions are invited, furnish the bank with the draft documents to be used, including the text of the invitation to prequalify, the prequalification questionnaire, and the evaluation methodology, together with a description of the advertising procedures to be followed, and shall introduce such modifications in said procedure and documents, as the bank shall reasonably request. the report evaluating the applications received by the borrower, the list of proposed prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications and of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for prequalification, shall be 46 59 for contracts procured on the basis of direct contracting under paras. 3.6 and 3.7, the borrower shall furnish to the bank for its approval, prior to contract execution, a copy of the specifications and the draft contract. the contract shall be executed only after the bank has given its approval, and the provisions in (h) of this paragraph shall apply with respect to the executed contract. furnished by the borrower to the bank for its comments before the applicants are notified of the borrower’s decision, and the borrower shall make such additions to, deletions from, or modifications in the said list as the bank shall reasonably request. (b) before bids are invited, the borrower shall furnish to the bank for its comments, draft bidding documents, including the invitation to bid; instructions to bidders, including the basis of bid evaluation and contract award; and the conditions of contract and specifications for the civil works, supply of goods, or installation of equipment, etc., as the case may be, together with a description of the advertising procedures to be followed for the bidding (if prequalification has not been used), and shall make such modifications in the said documents as the bank shall reasonably request. any further modification shall require the bank’s approval before it is issued to the prospective bidders. (c) after bids have been received and evaluated, the borrower shall, before a final decision on the award is made, furnish to the bank, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report (prepared, if the bank shall so request, by experts acceptable to the bank), on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together with the recommendations for award and such other information as the bank shall reasonably request. the bank shall, if it determines that the intended award would be inconsistent with the loan agreement and/or the procurement plan, promptly inform the borrower and state the reasons for such determination. otherwise, the bank shall provide its no objection to the recommendation for contract award. 47 the borrower shall award the contract only after receiving the “no objection” from the bank. (d) if the borrower requires an extension of bid validity to complete the process of evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and clearances, and to make the award, it should seek the bank’s prior approval for the first request for extension, if it is longer than four weeks, and for all subsequent requests for extension, irrespective of the period. (e) if after publication of the results of evaluation, the borrower receives protests or complaints from bidders, a copy of the complaint and a copy of the borrower’s response shall be sent to the bank for information. (f) if as result of analysis of a protest the borrower changes its contract award recommendation, the reasons for such decision and a revised evaluation report shall be submitted to the bank for no objection. the borrower shall provide a republication of the contract award in the format of paragraph 2.60 of these guidelines. (g) the terms and conditions of a contract shall not, without the bank’s prior approval, materially differ from those on which bids were asked or prequalification of contractors, if any, was invited. (h) one conformed copy of the contract shall be furnished to the bank promptly after its execution and prior to delivery to the bank of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the loan account in respect of such contract. where payments for the contract are to be made out of a special account (sa), a copy of the contract shall be furnished to the bank prior to the 48 making of the first payment out of the sa in respect of such contract. (i) all evaluation reports shall be accompanied by a summary of the procurement on a form provided by the bank. the description and amount of the contract, together with the name and address of the successful bidder, shall be subject to release by the bank upon receipt of the signed copy of the contract. 3. modifications. in the case of contracts subject to prior review, before granting a material extension of the stipulated time for performance of a contract, agreeing to any modification or waiver of the conditions of such contract, including issuing any change order or orders under such contract (except in cases of extreme urgency) which would in aggregate increase the original amount of the contract by more than 15 percent of the original price, the borrower shall seek the bank’s no objection to the proposed extension, modification, or change order. if the bank determines that the proposal would be inconsistent with the provisions of the loan agreement and/or procurement plan, it shall promptly inform the borrower and state the reasons for its determination. a copy of all amendments to the contract shall be furnished to the bank for its record. 4. translations. if a contract awarded under icb procedures is subject to prior-review and is written in the national language,60 (or the language used nation-wide in the borrower’s country for commercial transactions) a certified translation of the contract in the internationally used language specified in the bidding documents (english, french, or spanish) shall be furnished to the bank together with the conformed copy of the contract. such certified translations shall also be furnished to the bank, for any subsequent modifications of such contracts. 49 60 refer to para. 2.15. post review 5. the borrower shall retain all documentation with respect to each contract not governed by paragraph two during project implementation and up to two years after the closing date of the loan agreement. this documentation would include, but not be limited to, the signed original of the contract, the analysis of the respective proposals, and recommendations for award, for examination by the bank or by its consultants. the borrower shall also furnish such documentation to the bank upon request. if the bank determines that the goods, works or services were not procured in accordance with the agreed procedures, as reflected in the loan agreement and further detailed in the procurement plan approved by the bank or that the contract itself is not consistent with such procedures, it may declare misprocurement as established in paragraph 1.12 of the guidelines. the bank shall promptly inform the borrower the reasons for such determination. 50 appendix 2: domestic preferences preference for domestically manufactured goods 1. the borrower may, with the agreement of the bank, grant a margin of preference in the evaluation of bids under icb procedures to bids offering certain goods manufactured in the country of the borrower, when compared to bids offering such goods manufactured elsewhere. in such cases, bidding documents shall clearly indicate any preference to be granted to domestic manufactured goods and the information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such preference. the nationality of the manufacturer or supplier is not a condition for such eligibility. the methods and stages set forth hereunder shall be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids. 2. for comparison, responsive bids shall be classified in one of the following three groups: (a) group a: bids exclusively offering goods manufactured in the country of the borrower if the bidder establishes to the satisfaction of the borrower and the bank that (i) labor, raw material, and components from within the country of the borrower will account for 30 percent or more of the exw price of the product offered, and (ii) the production facility in which those goods will be manufactured or assembled has been engaged in manufacturing/assembling such goods at least since the time of bid submission. (b) group b: all other bids offering goods manufactured in the country of the borrower. (c) group c: bids offering goods manufactured abroad that have been 51 already imported or that will be directly imported. 3. the price quoted for goods in bids of groups a and b shall include all duties and taxes paid or payable on the basic materials or components purchased in the domestic market or imported, but shall exclude the sales and similar taxes on the finished product. the price quoted for goods in bids of group c shall be on cip (place of destination), which is exclusive of customs duties and other import taxes already paid or to be paid. 4. in the first step, all evaluated bids in each group shall be compared to determine the lowest bid in each group. such lowest evaluated bids shall be compared with each other and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from group a or group b is the lowest, it shall be selected for the award. 5. if as a result of the comparison under paragraph four above, the lowest evaluated bid is a bid from group c, the lowest evaluated bid from group c shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group a after adding to the evaluated price of goods offered in the bid from group c, for the purpose of this further comparison only, an amount equal to 15 percent of the cip bid price. the lowest evaluated bid determined from this last comparison shall be selected. 6. in the case of single responsibility or turnkey contracts for the supply of a number of discrete items of equipment as well as major installation and/or construction services no margin of preference shall apply.61 however, with bank’s “no objection”, bids for such 52 61 this does not refer to the supply of goods with supervision of installation in the same contract which is considered a contract for the supply of goods, and therefore eligible for the application of domestic preference in the goods component. contracts may be invited and evaluated on the basis of ddp62 (named place of destination) prices for goods manufactured abroad. preference for domestic contractors 7. for contracts for works to be awarded on the basis of icb, eligible borrowers may, with the agreement of the bank, grant a margin of preference of 7.5 percent to domestic contractors,63 in accordance with, and subject to, the following provisions: (a) contractors applying for such preference shall be asked to provide, as part of the data for qualification,64 such information, including details of ownership, as shall be required to determine whether, according to the classification established by the borrower and accepted by the bank, a particular contractor or group of contractors qualifies for a domestic preference. the bidding documents shall clearly indicate the preference and the method that will be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids to give effect to such preference. 53 62 ddp is the incoterm which stands for “delivered duty paid” where the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, cleared for import, and not unloaded from any arriving means of transport at the named place of destination. the seller has to bear all the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods thereto including, where applicable, any duty for import in the country of destination, and unloading at final destination as part of the turn-key contract. in countries that exempt bidders on imports under contracts financed by the bank, comparison shall be made on the basis of non- exemption of duties and taxes on importation of goods manufactured abroad and the bidding documents may indicate that, before contract signature, the purchaser and the winning bidder will identify the amount of taxes payable for importation of the goods offered resulting from that exemption. however, the contract amount to be signed will not include the identified total amount of exempted duties and taxes 63 preference for domestic contractors is applicable only in countries which qualify. 64 at the prequalification and/or at the bidding stage. (b) after bids have been received and reviewed by the borrower, responsive bids shall be classified into the following groups: (i) group a: bids offered by domestic contractors eligible for the preference. (ii) group b: bids offered by other contractors. for the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids, an amount equal to 7.5 percent of the bid amount shall be added to bids received from contractors in group b. 54 appendix 3: guidance to bidders purpose 1. this appendix provides guidance to potential bidders wishing to participate in bank-financed procurement. responsibility for procurement 2. the responsibility for the implementation of the project, and therefore for the payment of goods, works, and services under the project, rests solely with the borrower. the bank, for its part, is required by its articles of agreement to ensure that funds are paid from a bank loan only as expenditures are incurred. disbursements of the proceeds of a loan are made only at the borrower’s request. supporting evidence that the funds are used in accordance with the loan agreement and/or the procurement plan shall be submitted with the borrower’s withdrawal application. payment may be made (a) to reimburse the borrower for payment(s) already made from its own resources, (b) directly to a third party (usually to a supplier or contractor), or (c) to a commercial bank for expenditures against a world bank special commitment covering a commercial bank’s letter of credit.65 as emphasized in paragraph 1.2 of the guidelines, the borrower is legally responsible for the procurement. it invites, receives, and evaluates bids, and awards the contract. the contract is between the borrower and the supplier or contractor. the bank is not a party to the contract. bank’s role 3. as stated in paragraph 1.11 of the guidelines, the bank reviews the procurement procedures, documents, bid evaluations, award recommendations, and the contract to ensure 55 65 a complete description of the bank’s disbursement procedures is provided in the disbursement handbook (available on the bank’s website at http://www.worldbank.org/projects. that the process is carried out in accordance with agreed procedures, as required in the loan agreement. in the case of major contracts, the documents are reviewed by the bank prior to their issue, as described in appendix 1. also, if, at any time in the procurement process (even after the award of contract), the bank concludes that the agreed procedures were not followed in any material respect, the bank may declare misprocurement, as described in paragraph 1.12. however, if a borrower has awarded a contract after obtaining the bank’s “no objection,” the bank will declare misprocurement only if the “no objection” was issued on the basis of incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information furnished by the borrower. furthermore, if the bank determines that corrupt or fraudulent practices were engaged in by representatives of the borrower or of the bidder, the bank may impose the applicable sanctions set forth in paragraph 1.14 of the guidelines. 4. the bank has published standard bidding documents (sbds) for various types of procurement. as stated in paragraph 2.12 of the guidelines, it is mandatory for the borrower to use these documents, with minimum changes to address country- and project-specific issues. the prequalification and bidding documents are finalized and issued by the borrower. information on bidding 5. information on bidding opportunities under icb may be obtained from the general procurement notice and the specific procurement notices as described in paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8 of the guidelines. general guidance on participation, as well as advance information on business opportunities in upcoming projects, may be obtained from the world bank website66 as well as from the infoshop.67 project appraisal documents (pad) 56 66 http://www.worldbank.org. 67 the infoshop address is the world bank address at 1818 h street, n.w., washington, d.c., 20433, u.s.a. the project database is available at: http://www.worldbank.org/projects/. are also available from the infoshop and on the bank’s website upon approval of the loan. bidder’s role 6. once a bidder receives the prequalification or bidding document, the bidder should study the documents carefully to decide if it can meet the technical, commercial, and contractual conditions, and if so, proceed to prepare its bid. the bidder should then critically review the documents to see if there is any ambiguity, omission, or internal contradiction, or any feature of specifications or other conditions which are unclear or appear discriminatory or restrictive; if so, it should seek clarification from the borrower, in writing, within the time period specified in the bidding documents for seeking clarifications. 7. the criteria and methodology for selection of the successful bidder are outlined in the bidding documents, generally under instructions to bidders and specifications. if these are not clear, clarification should be similarly sought from the borrower. 8. in this connection it should be emphasized that the specific bidding documents issued by the borrower govern each procurement, as stated in paragraph 1.1 of the guidelines. if a bidder feels that any of the provisions in the documents are inconsistent with the guidelines, it should also raise this with the borrower. 9. it is the responsibility of the bidder to raise any issue of ambiguity, contradiction, omission, etc., prior to the submission of its bid, to assure submission of a fully responsive and compliant bid, including all the supporting documents requested in the bidding documents. noncompliance with critical (technical and commercial) requirements will result in rejection of the bid. if a bidder wishes to propose deviations to a noncritical requirement, or propose an alternative solution, the bidder should quote the price for the fully compliant bid and then separately indicate the 57 adjustment in price that can be offered if the deviation is accepted. alternative solutions should be offered only when authorized in the bidding documents. once bids are received and publicly opened, bidders will not be required or permitted to change the price or substance of a bid. confidentiality 10. as stated in paragraph 2.47 of the guidelines, the process of bid evaluation shall be confidential until the publication of contract award . this is essential to enable the borrower and bank reviewers to avoid either the reality or perception of improper interference. if at this stage a bidder wishes to bring additional information to the notice of the borrower, the bank, or both, it should do so in writing. action by the bank 11. bidders are free to send copies of their communications on issues and questions with the borrower to the bank or to write to the bank directly, when borrowers do not respond promptly, or the communication is a complaint against the borrower. all such communications should be addressed to the task team leader for the project, with a copy to the country director for the borrowing country and to the regional procurement adviser. names of task team leaders are available in the pad. 12. references received by the bank from potential bidders, prior to the closing date for submission of the bids, will, if appropriate, be referred to the borrower with the bank’s comments and advice, for action or response. 13. communication received from bidders after the opening of the bids, will be handled as follows. in the case of contracts not subject to prior review by the bank, the communication will be sent to the borrower for due consideration and appropriate action, if any, and these will be reviewed during subsequent supervision of the project by bank staff. in the cases of contracts subject to the prior review process, the communication will be examined 58 by the bank, in consultation with the borrower. if additional data is required to complete this process, these will be obtained from the borrower. if additional information or clarification is required from the bidder, the bank will ask the borrower to obtain it and comment or incorporate it, as appropriate, in the evaluation report. the bank’s review will not be completed until the communication is fully examined and considered. 14. except for acknowledgment, the bank will not enter into discussion or correspondence with any bidder during the evaluation and review process of the procurement, until award of the contract is published. debriefing 15. as stated in paragraph 2.65, if, after notification of award, a bidder wishes to ascertain the grounds on which its bid was not selected, it should address its request to the borrower. if the bidder is not satisfied with the explanation given and wishes to seek a meeting with the bank, it may do so by addressing the regional procurement adviser for the borrowing country, who will arrange a meeting at the appropriate level and with the relevant staff. in this discussion, only the bidder’s bid can be discussed and not the bids of competitors. 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66",

        "while in practice the specific procurement rules and procedures to be followed in the implementation of a project depend on the circumstances of the particular case, four considerations generally guide the bank’s requirements: (a) the need for economy and efficiency in the implementation of the project, including the procurement of the goods and works involved; (b) the bank’s interest in giving all eligible bidders from developed and developing countries6 the same information and equal opportunity to compete in providing goods and works financed by the bank; (c) the bank’s interest in encouraging the development of domestic contracting and manufacturing industries in the borrowing country; and (d) the importance of transparency in the procurement process",
